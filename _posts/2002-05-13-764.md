I am once again trying to e-mail post feature of <a href="http://pro.blogger.com/">blogger.com</a>.  I really like the idea of this feature but I have been experiencing problems with it in the past.  I just noticed a series of tests were finally posted to my weblog weeks after the messages were originally sent.  Hopefully that problem has been fix.
