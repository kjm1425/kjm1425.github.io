As some of you have already heard, I have become a hugh fan of weblogs and specifically <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">BLogger.com</a>. After playing with BLogger for a day, I upgrade to <a href="http://pro.blogger.com/">BLogger Pro</a>.  It is amazing how much easier it is for me to update and maintain my web sites using BLogger. I only wish I could use it within my corporate firewall for private team web sites on our intranet.

<br />So why am I sharing this with you?  Simple.  Pro Blogger has a new feature that allows me to publish new content through e-mail.  Yep, that's right.  I am composing this entry from Outlook.  Within seconds of sending out this e-mail, thecave.com will be updated.  Talk about a great service!  Now if I could publish my thoughts as I am riding the slopes...
