title: 'Adding Excel File Support To Killink CSV'

I received an email today from an individual asking if Excel files could be opened by [Killink CSV](http://www.killink.com/).  The person's goal is to load the Excel file into [Killink CSV](http://www.killink.com/) and save the data to a pipe delimited text file.  As far as I know this cannot be done in Excel, so guess what?

The next release of [Killink CSV](http://www.killink.com/) will support opening Excel files.  I'm still in the very early staging of coding and testing but so far so good.  This could be a useful feature for many.  Load and convert your Excel data to a delimited text file without having Excel installed!  Nice.

My only fear is that this feature might come back to haunt me.  I know very little about Excel and I imagine each version of Excel has its own file format.  I honestly don't know yet.  My tests so far have been limited to files created with Excel 2003.  Time and testing will tell.
