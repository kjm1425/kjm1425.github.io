## I'm So Glad We Had This Time Together:
WASTED II is over and the snow has finally returned to Whistler.  10 inches of the new stuff in the last 24 hours.  Just our luck.  Hopefully those who decided to stay over the weekend got to ride some of the new snow.  As for me, I am ready to ride the Northeast again, which is having a [great season](http://www.transworldsnowboarding.com/snow/news/article/0,13009,423155,00.html) albeit a very cold one.

Thanks to everyone would joined us this year, Melanie, Joe, Therese, Justin and his crew, Karen and Charlie, Katie, Ray, Brooke and Josh, Jeff, Tom, Kate and Shawn, and lastly Dave Dot.  And who knows, there just might be a WASTED III next year.

See you on the slopes.
