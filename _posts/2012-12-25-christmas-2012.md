Mother Nature was kind and gave us a little snow this morning, but it melted by mid-afternoon. I repeated the tradition I started a few years back by smoking a turkey for dinner. It's was delicious, but not has favor packed as it was 2 years ago. I blame it on the lack of thyme. The grocery store was all out when I went shopping. 

Rowan got lots of toys. It's hard to tell which ones are his favorite since he has played with them all. Melanie got a set of stemless wine glasses, which is something she has wanted for a long time. And they're the perfect companion to the wine chiller she got last Christmas. I got a new solar powered keyboard for my Mac, which I'm using right now to type this postings. And Rowan made me a coffee cup, which will be perfect for my hot cocoa fix.

Overall, it's been a good, low key Christmas, just the way we like it.
