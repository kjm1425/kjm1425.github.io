I was hoping to make one more trip to Killington this season before packing away the snowboard, but it doesn't look like it going to happen.  Killington announced today it will close on May 1st for the 2005-2006 season.  Looking at recent pictures I'm surprised they are able to stay open that long but Killington does have its image of staying open longer than any other East Coast resort to keep.  <br /><br />What a crappy season the East Coast had this year.  Here's hoping there will be much more snow next season.
