Melanie and I just returned from a fun weekend in Killington, VT with her family.  The snow was good Friday and Saturday but so-so on Sunday.  But the views on Sunday were great.  Our next trip is Park City next weekend with the Murphy's.  Can't wait.  It's our first Park City run.<br /><br /><br />
