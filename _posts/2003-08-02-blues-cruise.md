Melanie gave me a sweet surprise the other night as we celebrated two years together.  She treated me to an evening on the <a href="http://www.bluescruiseny.com/">Blues Cruise</a> with a live performance by <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;uid=CASS80307041006&amp;sql=B4gjteaz04xg7">Buckwheat Zydeco</a>.  For those wondering, the Blues Cruise is a cruise around New York harbor with live music.  Buckwheat had the boat a-rockin' and Melanie is the sweetest girlfriend ever for treating me to this unexpected surprise.
