After many months of no Xbox, I finally replaced mine this week with a brand new one.  Now I can start playing video games while I am sitting in the hotel.  But there's one problem.  Most hotels do not allow you to connect game consoles to the room TV.
<br />
<br />To get around this problem, I decided to try a couple of different mobile monitors.  The first was the Xbox Mobile Monitor from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006DY1K/103-2720723-1215069">Intec</a>.  This gives you a 5.6 inch LCD TFT screen.  The entire device snaps to the top of the game console and includes built-in speakers.  The problem I have with the Mobile Monitor is that the screen is too small to see while sitting back in a chair.  Also, the graphic quality is awful.  And finally, the overall size is too big for such a small screen.  I'm not able to keep my console stored in my carrying case with the Mobile Monitor installed.  The only pro was that I can use any controller for game play.
<br />
<br />The other device I tried was the <a href="http://www.hipgearproducts.com/xbox/default_xbox.html">Hip Screen Pad</a> from Hip Gear.  The monitor is much smaller, only 2.6 inch TFT screen, but the quality is excellent.  It's like looking at a very small TV.  Also, since the monitor is attached to the game controller, I am able to sit back in a chair, get comfortable, and play for hours.  My only compliant is with the controller's play action.  It is not as responsive as the S-controller.  The X button is slow to respond as is the left directional arrow on the cross hair pad.
<br />
<br />So after spending a night with each monitor I decided to stick with the Hip Screen Pad.  The overall size is much smaller, making it easier to carry when travelling.  And it's $80 cheaper with better screen quality.  I don't recommend Intec's Mobile Monitor purely based on the crappy screen resolution.
