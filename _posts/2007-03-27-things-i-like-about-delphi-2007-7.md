The 7th thing I like about Delphi 2007 is the "non-breaking" release.  In a nutshell this means DCU and packages compiled for BDS 2006 will work with Delphi 2007.  I initially had problems with some of the 3rd party packages I manually installed in Delphi 2007 so I didn't list this as one of the <a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive/2007/03/25/5_things_i_like_about_delphi_2007.aspx">5 things I like about Delphi 2007</a>.  But after resolving the issues (caused by me) I'm finding NO problems using 3rd party packages built for BDS 2006 in Delphi 2007.<br /><br /><ul><br /><li><a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive/2007/03/25/5_things_i_like_about_delphi_2007.aspx">Things I Like About Delphi 2007 #1-5</a></li><br /><li><a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive/2007/03/26/things_i_like_about_delphi_2007_6.aspx">Things I Like About Delphi 2007 #6</a></li><br /></ul>
