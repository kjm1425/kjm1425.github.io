I had a brief chance to check out Merant's <a href="http://www.merant.com/PVCS/products/version_manager/index.html">PVCS Version Manager</a> - the web version of their Version Control Software.  I was impressed by the offering but I still prefer <a href="http://www.cvshome.org/">CVS</a> with <a href="http://www.tortoisecvs.org/">TortoiseCVS</a>.
