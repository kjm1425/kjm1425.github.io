[Four years ago today](http://www.thecave.com/archive/2002/03) thecave.com changed [its look](http://web.archive.org/web/20020123100039/http://www.thecave.com/) and became my personal blog.  A lot has happened since that time.  I got married, left my corporate job to start [my own company](http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/), made trips to Paris, Nice, Brussels, and Italy, was the ICCA NYC chapter president for a year, and most recently moved from New York City to Salem, Massachusetts.  It's been an incredible ride that is showing no signs of slowing down.
