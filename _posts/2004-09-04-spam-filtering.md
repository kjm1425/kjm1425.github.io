Attention @thecave e-mail users. The default for spam filtering is as follows:
<br />
<br />- Messages with LOW spam probability will remain in your Inbox with the subject prefix "SPAM-LOW:".
<br />
<br />- Messages with MEDIUM and HIGH spam probability will be moved to the Junk E-mail folder.
<br />
<br />You can override this by going to Settings|My Spam Filtering.
