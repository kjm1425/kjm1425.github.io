title: 'Ranking Programming Language Popularity'

While reading about the recent Microsoft MVP <a href="http://rblevin.blogspot.com/2005/03/microsoft-mvps-revolt.html">revolt</a> regarding VB and VB.NET I came across a link (see below) that shows the popularity of programming languages.  Delphi is currently ranked 10th and has moved up the rankings since last year.  I definitely plan to keep an eye on this site to see if Delphi continues to move up.  And as for the revolt, maybe the developers forced to rewrite all those lines of VB code to VB.NET will consider migrating to Delphi.
