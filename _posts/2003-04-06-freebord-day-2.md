I took the freebord out for another 30 minute while in Bryn Athyn for the weekend, and quickly learned that the hills were too big for me.  I did a nice concrete roll while trying to stop and I struggled to link turns.  The board is definitely harder to ride than a normal skateboard.  Speed is a good thing to have when learning to ride but too much speed is a bad thing.  I'll probably buy elbow pads before trying it again in BA.
