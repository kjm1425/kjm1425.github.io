Melanie and I had our first in over 2 months NYC Saturday together where it was just the two of us.  We hit <a href="http://www.55bar.com/">55 Bar</a> for some great blues music and the singing of Sweet Georgia Brown.  The late show set was definite the best, with lots of energy and excitement coming from the crowd.  The evening reminded me how much fun Saturday night can be in NYC.<br /><br /><br />
