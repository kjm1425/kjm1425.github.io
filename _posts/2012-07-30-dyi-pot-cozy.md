I'm preparing to take a long distance hike in a few weeks (more details on that coming soon), so I've been researching different ways to reduce the amount of fuel I need for cooking. I came around this neat posting that explains <a href="http://blackwoodspress.com/blog/6582/ultralight-backpacking-pot-cozy/">how to make an backpacking pot cozy</a>. It sounds like a neat idea, and perfect for me since I plan to eat a lot of Mac-n-Cheese on the hike. So I took a stab at making my <a href="http://photos.thecave.com/Random/DYI-Pot-Cozy/24476733_NV9jrG">own pot cozy</a> for my <a href="http://www.snowpeak.com/cookware/backpacking/trek-700-titanium-scs-005t.html">Snow Peak Trek 700 titanium mug</a>. I'm happy with the end results, but I have yet to test the cozy to see how effective it is. That will be my next project later this week.
