Over the last two weeks, I have been replicating my blog posting to thecave.com and wastedboarding.com.  WASTED II is now over so I will return to only posting to appropriate site, which will be primarily this site cocked full with my rumblings.  And I will start the rumble with a comment about my iPod.
<br />
<br />The iPod kicks!  I love this puppy.  All day travel yesterday was made much more enjoyable with my iPod in pocket.  Random play on 10 gigs of music for over 10 hours and still plenty of battery life left.  It's the only way to travel.
