[High royalty rates could kill web radio including Pandora](http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2008/08/18/pandora-says-high-royalty-rates-are-putting-them-out-of-business/). This is very disturbing news for me because I listen to a lot of web radio especially Pandora.  I rarely if ever listen to AM/FM radio these days and web radio is my only insight to new music.  Web radio influences me to buy new music.

As I [mentioned before](http://www.thecave.com/archive/2008/03/05/a_better_way_to_buy_music) I have only recently started buying new music again. A big part of this is has to do with the availability of DRM-free music. And the music I do buy now is heavily influenced by what I hear on Pandora and other web radio stations.  If web radio dies because of the insanely high royalty rates then there's a good chance my music buying habits will die off too as I will end up going back and listening to only the music I already have.
