title: 'Is it E-mail or Email?'

I remember having a conversation with a friend of mine 10 years ago about "e-mail" versus "email".  Should the dash be used or not?  I don't remember how we arrived to a conclusion but I do remember we concluded that "e-mail" was the appropriate spelling.  But is that correct?<br /><br />I did a google search on "<a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive/2005/06/25/masking_addresses_to_prevent_email_harvesting.aspx">Masking Addresses to Prevent E-mail Harvesting</a>", the title of a recent blog posting.  I did this to see if my web site had been index based on this phrase.  It was and it was fourth from the top on the first page of hits.  However, google being the smart one it is asked "Did you mean: Masking Addresses to Prevent Email Harvesting".  Notice there is no dash in the word "email".<br /><br />My site does not appear on the first page when searching google using the phrase without the dash in the word "e-mail".  As a matter of fact my site does not come up on any of the first 10 pages.  I stopped looking after ten pages but I bet it is safe to assume my site doesn't show up at all on that search phrase.<br /><br />Being the curious type that I am, I decided to remove the dash from the title and text of <a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive/2005/06/25/masking_addresses_to_prevent_email_harvesting.aspx">that blog item</a>.  I'll give it 24 to 48 hours before checking google to see the effect.
