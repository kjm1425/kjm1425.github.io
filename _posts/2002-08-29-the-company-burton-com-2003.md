From <a href="http://www.burton.com/">Burton's</a> 2003 web site:
<br />
<br />We stand sideways.
<br />We sleep on floors in cramped resort hotel rooms.
<br />We get up early and go to sleep late.
<br />We've been mocked.
<br />We've been turned away from resorts that won't have us.
<br />We are relentless.
<br />We dream it, we make it, we break it, we fix it.
<br />We create.
<br />We destroy.
<br />We wreck ourselves day in and day out and yet we stomp that one trick or find that one line that keeps us coming back.
<br />We progress.
