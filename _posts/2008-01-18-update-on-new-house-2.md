Work on the house is nearing completion.  4 rooms are now ready to go and I hope to have 2 more rooms completed by Saturday night.  This leaves 1 room left to complete before we move in, which is now scheduled for Thursday, January 24.  If I stay on track, I'll have the final room completed on Monday.  New carpet on the stairs will be installed on Tuesday.  And we clean, clean, clean on Wednesday to get up all the dust and dirt from the floors.

Thanks to all who have helped over the last few weeks, Brooke, Josh, Darren (major thanks to Darren), Dana, and especially Zack, the little helper in the picture.
