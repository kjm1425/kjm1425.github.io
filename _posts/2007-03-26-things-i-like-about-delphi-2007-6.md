title: 'Things I Like About Delphi 2007 #6'

The number 6 thing I like about <a href="http://www.codegear.com/delphi">Delphi 2007</a> is the new message output for compiles.  It provides detailed information about the compile including the dcc32.exe command line.  It's nice to see this level of detail especially when odd things start to happen.
