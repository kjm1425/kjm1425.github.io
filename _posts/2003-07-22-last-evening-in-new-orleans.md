My New Orleans trip is almost over.  Events are winding down and people are heading home.  The trip highlights for me have been (in no particular order and aside from the primary reason for me being here):

- [Acme Oyster House](http://www.acmeoyster.com/)
- [Krystal](http://www.krystal.com/)
- Bourbon Street of course
- Events at the Super Dome and Louis Armstrong Park
- [The Brian Setzer Orchestra](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;uid=CASS80307041006&amp;sql=B2etqoayabij9)
- Catching up with friends, especially Norm from St. Louis
- And lastly beer and the open container ordinance

I've had so much that I think a Jazz Fest trip is in order.  Besides, it would be a blast to be here for Jazz Fest with Melanie.  Maybe I will organize something.
