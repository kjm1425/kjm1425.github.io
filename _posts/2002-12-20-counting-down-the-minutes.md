I am counting down the minutes to my departure from Jacksonhell, FL, and my return north to spend time with my squeeze and to once again ride the slopes of Killington.  Pico opened last weekend so we might hit it on Sunday.  I wonder what Beer Mountain is like this weekend.  Yes, I said it again...Beer Mountain.
<br />
<br />I wish there were a way to control time.  I would speed it up to the point where Melanie and I arrive in Killington then slow it down over the weekend so the time together seems to last forever.
