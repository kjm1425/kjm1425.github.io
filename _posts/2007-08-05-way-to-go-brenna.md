Brenna Davis, my sister-in-law, isn't joining my wife's family this week for the Davis clan's annual family vacation.  Instead [Brenna is representing the USOC at a sport festival in Turkey](http://www.udel.edu/PR/UDaily/2008/jul/usoc073107.html).  What an awesome opportunity for Brenna.

Brenna, congrats on being selected and have a blast in Turkey.
