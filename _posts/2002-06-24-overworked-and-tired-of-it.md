title: 'Overworked and tired of it!'

It pretty much common knowledge that [Americans are overworked](http://www.hrmguide.net/usa/worklife/unused_vacation.htm).  And this is specially true in the [IT](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/I/IT.html) community.  This has been bothering me a lot lately as things other than work are becoming top priorities in my life.  (Sidenote: For those wondering, those other things include Melanie and snowboarding.)

Here is how I see it.  I get paid for 40 hours a week of work yet I typically work an average of 10 additional hours each week including holiday weeks.  So my employer gets an additional 10 hours of work per week out of my for free.  I get 4 weeks of vacation each year, a very nice perk from my employer, so this means I typically work 48 weeks out of the year.  With that extra 10 hours a week, that means my employer is getting 480 hours of free labor out of me per year.  480 hours is roughly 3 work months.  3 months of free labor each year.  I can't believe I am letting this happen.

And to think there was a time I worked even more hours.
