title: 'Digital River Buys eSellerate'
category: business
---

I received an email today from <a href="http://www.esellerate.net/">eSellerate</a> saying that they are now part of the Digital River team.  I'm not sure how I feel about this news.  I have been using eSellerate for a year now and I'm a very happy eSellerate customer.  Their services are great, and I haven't even tapped into everything they offer yet.  <br /><br />My concern with today's announcement is that I decided last year not to go with Digitial River or any of its other companies as the e-commerce provider for <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/">White Peak Software</a>.  I don't remember the details of why I didn't chose them, but I do remember thinking eSellerate was the better choice for my company.  Had this acquisition happened a year ago would I have still chosen eSellerate?  I don't know.<br /><br />The announcement from eSellerate did say, "Be assured that we plan to provide the same personal level of service you have come to expect from all of us here at eSellerate. Your eSellerate technical support, sales, development, and management teams will continue supporting you from our Lincoln, Nebraska headquarters."  This is good to know, but only time will tell if the acquisition is a good thing for eSellerate and their customers.
