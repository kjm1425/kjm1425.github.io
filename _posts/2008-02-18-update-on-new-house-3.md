We're finally in the new house.  Woohoo!!  Work on all the rooms is basically complete with one exception, the upstairs half bathroom, which can wait a couple of weeks.  We're slowly settling in with a little more than half the boxes already unpacked.  And we're planning a shopping trip for later this week to purchase new furniture for the baby's room.<br /><br />I'm so glad to be done with the majority of the renovation work.  Overall I'm happy with the end results, but there are areas on some walls I would like to redo someday.  But I can't complain.  After all, this was my first time doing home renovating work like this.  I definitely learned a lot and will do much better work faster in the future.<br /><br />I would like to send out a special thank you to my mom and brother for helping prepare the house.  Without their help on the final days leading up to the move, we might have had to postpone the move in date a second time.  Thanks for the help mom and Andy.
