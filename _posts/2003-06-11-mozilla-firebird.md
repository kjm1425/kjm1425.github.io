I have started playing with the latest build of the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firebird/">Mozilla Firebird</a> browser and I must say "Daddy likes."  It has some very cool features including tabbed browsers, which I am starting to really like as it keeps my desktop clean.  My only compliant so for is using it with the latest Outlook Web Access, which I use to access office e-mail from the customer site.  Mozilla repeatedly prompts for my user name and password over and over for each resource being download.  Aside from OWA, I have not found any problems and I am considering making it my default browser.
