Melanie and I ended our ski/snowboard season this weekend in Killington, VT.  The spring time conditions were great.  Mash potato bumps, slush, and firm snowpack could be found throughout.  Saturday was mostly cloudy to very cloudy while Sunday was nothing but blue bird skies.<br /><br />We didn't get in as many days as we have in past seasons but that was expected given the wedding and all.  Still this season gave us the best snow conditions either of us have seen while we were in Whistler.  This season also gave us our first visit to Park City, UT, where we got to visit with Kate and Shawn.  We got some hang time with Brooke and Josh on a Killington weekend trip.  I completed my snowboard/Lord of the Rings birthday trilogy.  And we got to spend time on the slopes of Killington with the whole Davis crew.<br /><br />Even though it was a short season for us, it was still a great one.  And it has left me wanting more.  I can't wait until next season.<br /><br /><br />
