It should be illegal to sell a house with wallpaper.  And the punishment should double for those who wallpaper the ceiling too.

The wife and I are working like eager beavers to get the [house](http://thecave.smugmug.com/gallery/3997880/1/232528797) ready for a January move in date.  And while January is still a couple of weeks away we only a have few more work days left this month for house work due to the holiday.  And the task that is slowing us down the most?  You guessed it.  Wallpaper!
