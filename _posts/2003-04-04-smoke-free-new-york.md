New York City has ban smoking in the bars.  And although I think people should be free to smoke in public, I have to admit I enjoyed coming home from the bar last night not smelling of smoke.  Melanie said after returning "It was like not being at a bar" because either of us smelled.  I think I might be in favor of the ban after all.
