I will be out of the office for the next few days.  I'm heading to Atlanta today, where the temperature is actually cooler right now then in NYC, to attend the <a href="http://www.icca.org/confinfo_june2005.asp">ICCA National Conference</a>.  I'm looking forward to a number of the keynotes and sessions including <a href="http://www.icca.org/confinfo_june2005-DayTwo.asp#Lautenslager">Guerrilla Marketing in 30 Days</a> and <a href="http://www.icca.org/confinfo_june2005-DayTwo.asp#Heckler">Building Sales by Showing Up on Top in Google</a>.
