title: 'New CEO at CodeGear'

[Jim Douglas replaces Ben Smith as CEO for CodeGear](http://dn.codegear.com/article/34365).  This move makes no sense to me, but then again I have never really understood [Corporate America](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_America).

In my opinion [Ben Smith](http://blogs.codegear.com/bensmith/) seems like a fine CEO for CodeGear.  I have admired his openness and his willingness to connect with the developer community.  Heck, he has even [responded](http://www.thecave.com/archive/2007/03/19/developers_do_matter_at_codegear) to blog posting here at [thecave.com](http://www.thecave.com/) as well as to other blog sites.  His actions have given me greater confidence in the future of CodeGear.  But this latest move by CodeGear has me scratching my head wondering what the future will hold for CodeGear.

Best of luck to Ben.  I for one think you did a great job kick starting CodeGear.
