Today marks my 25th day snowboarding this season. While this might sound awesome, it's fewer days than I was hoping to have by mid-January. I snowboarded 21 days up through Christmas. That means I have only snowboarded 4 days since Christmas, which is why I thought I would have more days by now.

There are a couple of reasons I've only gotten in 4 days over the last 3 weeks:

1. My season pass has blackout dated between December 26 and December 31. 
2. Warm temperatures and rain last week left the hill in less than ideal conditions, so I didn't go out.

Thankfully winter has returned to Stowe, and I've been able to hit the slopes again. And with more snow in the forecast I'm hoping to see my day count increase more rapidly in the coming weeks.

Oh, and just to be clear my days on the hill are not full days like you would do when on vacation. I still have a [job][wps] and I have to work. So when I go out for a day in Stowe it's usually only for an hour and a half to two hours. I might do longer days when snowboarding with Rowan and Melanie, but in general my days on the slope are the equivalent to someone else going to the gym or running or doing some other form of regular exercise.
