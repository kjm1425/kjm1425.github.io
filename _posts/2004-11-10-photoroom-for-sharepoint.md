title: 'PhotoRoom for SharePoint?'
category: uncategorized
---

There was an interesting <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1176619&amp;forum_id=183061">question</a> on the help forum for PhotoRoom.  I have been doing more and more with SharePoint over the last month and this idea really excites me.  PhotoRoom for SharePoint.  Sounds like a fun project to do.  More to come soon.
