I'm not sure I would <a href="http://uncrate.com/stuff/the-cave-tent/">buy this tent</a>, but I do like the name. An inflatable tent does sound interesting, but at 11.5 pounds plus a hand pump, I'm not sure it's for me. Then again, my current "big" tent does take 5 to 10 minutes to setup and teardown.
