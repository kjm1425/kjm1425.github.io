title: 'E-mail versus Email Revisited'
category: uncategorized
---

It's been 48 hours since I changed e-mail to email and the winner is "email".  It seems the google will search for both "e-mail" and "email" when "email" is used in the search string.  However, it will only search for "e-mail" when "e-mail" is used in the search string.  Based on this I will stop using the dash when I write the word email.<br /><br />On a related note, I found google has index the wrong page on my site when searching the phrase "Masking Addresses to Prevent Email Harvesting".  It has indexed the page www.whitepeaksoftware.com/blog.aspx?xml/2005_06_01_archive.xml but I assumed it would have indexed the page <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/archive/2005/06/25/masking_addresses_to_prevent_email_harvesting.aspx"> http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/archive/2005/06/25/masking_addresses_to_prevent_email_harvesting.aspx</a>.  Go figure.<br /><br />Also, I wonder how google will index my blog entries given that each entry is available from thecave.com and whitepeaksoftware.com.  Time will tell.
