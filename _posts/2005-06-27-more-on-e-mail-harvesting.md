The Federal Trade Commission published a report on <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/alerts/spamalrt.htm">e-mail harvesting</a>.  Investigators seeded 175 different locations with 250 new e-mail addresses to see what would happen.  Over 3,000 spam messages were received during the first six weeks.  The investigators found:<ul><br /><li>"86 percent of the addresses posted to web pages received spam. It didn't matter where the addresses were posted on the page: if the address had the "@" sign in it, it drew spam."</li><br /><li>"86 percent of the addresses posted to newsgroups received spam."</li></ul>Based on the findings in this report, my trick of masking e-mail addresses on my web sites should definitely help prevent future harvesting of my addresses.
