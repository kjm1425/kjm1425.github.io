Congratulations to my sister Renay and her new husband Tommy, who were married earlier today.  It is really hard to believe my little sister has become a beautiful young lady.  I wish the two of them total happiness in their new life as husband and wife.  And a special "good luck" to Tommy who is going to need it.  Just joking, Renay.  I love you both.
