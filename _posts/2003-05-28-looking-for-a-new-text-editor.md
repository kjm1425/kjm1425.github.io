title: 'Looking for a new text editor'
category: uncategorized

For many years, I used <a href="http://www.multiedit.com/">MultiEdit</a> as my primary text editor.  I loved that program.  It did everything I needed except one thing.  It does not support Unicode files.  Lately I have been using Visual Studio.NET as my editor of choice but there are things I don't like about it either.  For example, sometimes I want to create a simple console app and I don't want to have to create a VS.NET project for it.  I would rather get create a new .cs file and F9 to compile it, or something like that.  MultiEdit will do this but as I mentioned it does not support Unicode.
<br />
<br />So my question for all: What would you recommend as a sweet text editor that I can use as my editor of choice?  And please, don't say Notepad.
