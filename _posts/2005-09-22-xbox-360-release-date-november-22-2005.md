According to EBgames.com, the official street date for the Xbox 360 is November 22, 2005.  I pre-ordered my 360 with overnight delivery, but given that the 22nd is only a couple of days before Thanksgiving I should have requested standard ground shipping.  Chances are good I will be out of town when the shipment is delivered.  Oh well.
