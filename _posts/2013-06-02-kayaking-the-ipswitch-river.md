It was the perfect way to spend a Saturday morning. We put in at Thunder Bridge, made our way east through the Ipswich Wildlife Sanctuary, and finally stopped in the town of Ipswich. 

We keep a fast pace so I didn't get a chance to take a lot of pictures, but I need sneak in a few [shots][gallery].
