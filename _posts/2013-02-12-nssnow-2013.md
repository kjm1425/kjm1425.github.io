Last week Melanie and I had the pleasure to join 13 others in [Courchevel, France](http://www.courchevel.com), for NSSnow 2013. NSSnow is a gathering of mostly Mac and iOS developers who love to ski and snowboard, well, mostly snowboard but skiers were welcome - Melanie was the token skier at this year's NSSnow. 

This year was the first NSSnow and it was simply amazing. Rob Elkin did an outstanding job organizing the week long event, and Mother Nature smiled on us with new snow almost daily. I rode the most powder and deepest powder I've ever ridden, and it was AWESOME! Combine that with meeting great new friends and it was the perfect snowboard vacation getaway.

For those who didn't make it to NSSnow, and for those who did and want to re-live the moments, here are photos from the incredible week.
