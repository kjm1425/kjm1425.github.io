Earlier this week CodeGear released Update 1 for Delphi 2007.  I run Delphi 2007 on my laptop in a VMware virtual machine with XP as the guest OS.  Update 1 installed without a problem.  It took longer than expected, about 45 minutes, but the wait was worth the update.<br /><br />There are many fixes and improvements in Update 1 but the one I noticed right away was the improvements to the online help.  In March I complained that many Delphi routines were not indexed in the online help.  Update 1 fixes this problem which means I no longer need to refer back to BDS 2006 help.<br /><br />Other Delphi news this week...CodeGear as published the <a href="http://dn.codegear.com/article/36620">Delphi Roadmap</a>.  Highlander is still scheduled for release later this year.  Highlander will combine Delphi.NET, Delphi Win32, and C++ Builder into the 2007 RAD Studio, and .NET 2.0 support be provided.<br /><br />Most interesting to me, however, is the release of Tiburon, which is planned for release during the first half of 2008.  This release will provide Unicode support throughout.  This is huge for me since I need to provide Unicode support in my native Windows based application.
