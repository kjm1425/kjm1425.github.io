The fine folks at <a href="http://www.thesaleminsider.com/">The Salem Insider</a> are compiling a list of Salem-based bloggers.  If you live in Salem Mass and have a blog, you should <a href="http://www.thesaleminsider.com/2008/08/26/do-you-blog/">add your blog site</a> to the list.  And no, your blog site doesn't have to be about Salem.  They just ask that you be a Salem resident.  It's a neat way to see what others in Salem are writing about.
