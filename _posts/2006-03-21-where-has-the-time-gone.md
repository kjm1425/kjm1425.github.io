Wow!  Has it really been over a month since my last blog posting?  I guess so.  I didn't realize so much time had passed.  Guess that's what happens when you are busy.<br /><br />I've been traveling back and forward between Salem and St. Louis this month to teach a series of classes on XML, XSD, XSLT, and Web services.  As expected the first class was a bit rough but the other classes have been a lot of fun.  <br /><br />I never realized how much work goes into preparing for a class.  I have been putting in countless hours preparing course materials, demos, hand-ons exercises, and labs.  And let's not forget the prep time for speaking.  I'm heading out tomorrow morning to teach the last two days of the class.  It will seem weird not having to think about the classes next week.<br /><br />For those wondering about the status of SMTP Diagnostics 1.6, it's coming.  The beta release is available from the <a href="">download page</a> and the final release will be available within 2 weeks.<br /><br />I'm also working through the marketing research for another product idea.  I should have more to report in 6 to 7 weeks if I decide to go forward with the new idea.  Meanwhile, Vertigo is still in the works but it's turning into a much larger project then I originally expected.  A release for this summer is unlikely.<br /><br />That's a quick update of what's happening.  Hopefully it won't be another 4 to 5 weeks before my next posting.
