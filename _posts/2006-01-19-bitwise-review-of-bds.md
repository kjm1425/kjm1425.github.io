The January 2006 issue of the online magazine Bitwise Magazine has a good <a href="http://www.bitwisemag.com/copy/reviews/software/programming/borland/bds2006.html">review of Borland Developer Studio</a>.  The reviewer makes some very good points, although I do not complete agree with one point, C# programmers will prefer Visual Studio.  As someone who also writes code in C# I prefer BDS over Visual Studio.  I'm more productive using a single IDE then using two separate IDE.  Using two separate IDE means I have to remember two sets of the hotkeys, how-to's, and so on.
