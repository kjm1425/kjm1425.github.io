After a full day of research, learning the ins and outs of writing <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/01/12/NetServ/NetServ.asp">Windows Services</a> using .NET, and using more about <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl">WSDL</a>, it is time for me to sign-off for a few days.  Melanie and I are driving up to <a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?zoom=2&amp;mapdata=b2d68tAsVaFv0L5HBfqIXjr47QsQxfIar7sm2ve3LBV1yyD9idZNXPb%2fh%2bjqdMRGlvSa7HhCKWAI%2bZOc7e2YhMF177pWgfzSftcJn93SKoxbhpXQFvXy7FEtm8MnffZOJUOAvLY%2fm3PdgEWpMceO3Tz2bUucMiVOyokh8l4YfRHJ0XbbHCUY6ASII5zt03615UQjUokAQtAoEfa%2b1pVE9%2fg2QwDIIhJLG4ZWLD5RjgFTlQAwikmxRDdUodWqbRelva0nvzX9XnKO1lfOXHmuQA%3d%3d">Stowe, VT</a> for the holiday weekend.  And no we are not leaving the city because of the various terrorist threats.  We are leaving town because we have a 4 day holiday and I have wanted to see Vermont in the summer time for a very long time.
<br />
<br />If we have time and are able, I will post entries about our trip but don't count on it.  I am hoping for a geek-free weekend.
