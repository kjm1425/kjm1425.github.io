"On the road again.  I can't wait to be on the road again."  Blah, blah.

<br />Melanie and I are heading to her home town this afternoon to attend a wedding.  We plan on spending the rest of the weekend there so she can visit with her sisters and I can write an article on the ten top things to consider when building a web service.  I'm not exactly sure how I got sucker into writing this article, but once it is done I will be excited about it.
