Break out the sunblock, put on the <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/tshirts/generic/">geek t-shirt</a>, and enjoy some fun in the sun.  It's not a day on the beach.  It's a day on the slopes enjoying some spring time snowboarding.<br /><br />Melanie and I wrapped up our ski/snowboard season this weekend in Killington.  The snow was great, a little heavy, but fast.  We worked our legs to death.  And the grilled burgers and tasty beers on the deck at Bear Mountain deck really hit the spot.  We finished the season wanting more.  I'm already excited about my next day on the slopes in November.
