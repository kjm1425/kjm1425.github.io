title: 'O''Reilly''s big mistake'
category: uncategorized

I have always been a big fan of <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly</a>.  The books are great, the web sites are useful, and Safari is my favorite.  But after O'Reilly's attempt to implement a single sign on for all their sites I am left with multiple user profiles, one for O'Reilly sites and one for my Safari account which I can now only access through a different URL.  Having multiple accounts is not exactly single sign on in my opinion.<br /><br />And I'm still fuming over not being able to access Safari for more than 24 hours.  Unfortunately I really needed access yesterday too.<br /><br />I'm very surprised that a company like O'Reilly has let something like this happen.  I have always thought the company was better than that.  Hopefully improvements will come soon now that lessons have been learned.<br /><br /><br />
