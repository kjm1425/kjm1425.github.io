[Robert Scoble](http://scoble.weblogs.com/) and [Steve Rubel](http://www.micropersuasion.com/) are organizing an NYC Geek Dinner Night for Monday, May 2.  Details can be found [here](http://www.micropersuasion.com/2005/04/scoble_rubel_ho.html).  <strike>I'm thinking about going.</strike>

**Update:** I'm not going to make the geek dinner tonight.  I'm working on an application framework for Vertigo.
