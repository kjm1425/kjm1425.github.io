Melanie and I decided to take a weekend off from snow riding and what happens?  A Noreastern dumps in New England.  Sunday River got 30 inches.  Attitash received 24 new inches.  Just our luck to miss the fresh powder once again.<br /><br />Speaking of snowboarding, I finally posted new pictures from our recent Big Sky trip.  And pictures from the Redneck Shindig are in the <a href="http://www.thecave.com/gallery.aspx">gallery</a> as well.  Enjoy.
