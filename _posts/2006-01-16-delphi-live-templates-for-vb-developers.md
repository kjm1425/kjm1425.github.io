[Nick Hodges](http://www.lemanix.com/nickblog/default.aspx) has created a set of [Delphi Live Templates for VB developers](http://www.lemanix.com/nickblog/PermaLink,guid,e407798f-32bd-43cb-96d9-e1f5b04ae316.aspx) who have moved to Delphi.  This templates work with the latest version of Borland Developer Studio.  The developer to type VBish code and the templates spit out Delphi code.  For instance, type "MsgBox" and you get "MessageDlg".
