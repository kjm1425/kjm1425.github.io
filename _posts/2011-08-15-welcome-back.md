Hey! What's going on here? A new blog post after more than a year and a half?

Yes, that's right. I'm slowing getting back into the swing of things, and one of those things is updating thecave.com with my pointless, boring, thoughts.

A lot has happened since that last post in December 2009. My company, [White Peak Software](http://whitepeaksoftware.com/), has changed directions and is now focused entirely on iOS and Mac OS X development. Rowan has gotten older.  And I'm nearing the end of writing my [first book](http://learnipadprogramming.com/).

Time will tell if I'm truly back into the swing of things, but I'm hopeful I will have more time to post personal rants. Welcome backâ€¦to me.
