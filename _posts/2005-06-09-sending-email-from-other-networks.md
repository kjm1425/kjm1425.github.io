I am preparing the first beta release of a new application that is used for diagnosing problems with SMTP.  The program allows the user to test account settings against an SMTP server by sending a test message.<br /><br />I have been testing the program from various locations including the hotel here in Atlanta.  I was surprised to see that the network here redirects SMTP requests to its own SMTP server which relays the message to the appropriate destination.  No wonder laptop users have problems with email.  The experience behind the scenes can be different based on the network and the user may never know.<br /><br /><a href="/images/blogimages/smtpdiagnosticsnapshot01.JPG"><img src="/images/blogimages/smtpdiagnosticsnapshot01.JPG" border="0" width="380" height="331" /></a><br />Click image to enlarge.
