I lived in the West Village, Manhattan for just over 6 years.  Earlier this year my wife and I moved to Salem, Massachusetts.  We have a number of reasons for moving such as a change in life style, wanting to be closer to the mountains of New England, etc.  Cost is definitely one of the reasons.  We were spending more and more time outside of NYC making it hard to justify paying high rent for an apartment we didn't see much, especially in the winter time.  <br /><br />I was surprise to learn that Essex County, Massachusetts, which is where Salem is located, is ranked at the top of the recent <a href="http://realestate.msn.com/Rentals/Articleforbes.aspx?cp-documentid=648559&amp;GT1=8384">Forbes most overprice places in the United States</a>.  (New York is ranked number 6.)  Granted we don't live in one of the <a href="http://rmne-remaxadvantagerealestate-salem-ma.com/Properties/PropDispForm.php?idx_prop=101582664&amp;QueryID=44b53c2373630&amp;3">awesomely big water front homes</a> mentioned in the article.  I wish we did.  But homes at a million and more is beyond what we can afford.  I will say, though, that $1.4 million for a 4,000 square foot water front home does seem like a better deal to me than a $1.4 million, 2 bedroom, 900 square foot condo in downtown Manhattan.
