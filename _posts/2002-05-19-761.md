After spending the last few hours trying to access CVS repository stored on Windows 2000 through SSH, I finally give up.  My final conclusion is the CVSNT does not work SSH when CVSNT is on the server-side.  From all I have read and seen, CVSNT with SSH works fine with the CVS server is some flavor of Unix.  This bums me out because I really don't care to install Linux at home and I would like to use TortoiseCVS as my WinCVS GUI client.
<br />
<br />All is not lost though.  I think I can use another WinCVS to access my CVS repository.  I was able to successfully access it with the CVS command line using SSPI for Windows authentication.  And by using the -x, you can ensure that the network traffic is encrypted.  Still, I would rather use SSH.
