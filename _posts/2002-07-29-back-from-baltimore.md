We made it back from Baltimore.  This weekend was a total blast.  Bo Dollis &amp; <a href="http://www.wildmagnolias.net/">The Wild Magnolias</a> were joined by a couple of Mardi Gras indians from Bo's tribe.  And as always Buckwheat Zydeco got the crowd moving and left them wanting more.  Rachel and Fernando were excellent hosts, and it was really nice to catch up with Linda and Jeff.  All and all, it was a great weekend.  Too bad we couldn't stay longer.
