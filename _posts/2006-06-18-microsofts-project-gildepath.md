Microsoft has created a new web site called <a href="http://www.projectglidepath.net/">Project Glidepath</a>.  As I understand it, the goal of the site is to help small software companies to get up to speed on the flurry of new technologies coming from Microsoft such as Windows Vista and WPF.<br /><br />From the web site's home page:<br /><br />"The release of Windows Vista will create a new wave of demand for applications that MicroISVs supply. We at Microsoft know how many new features and APIs we have added to Windows Vista as well as we understand how challenging it is to start and keep a MicroISV business running. Project Glidepath is designed to provide the knowledge you, as a MicroISV, need to be successful by providing step-by-step instructions for everything from how to get started with Windows Presentation Foundation to how to write and publish a press release."<br /><br /><a href="http://safarisoftware.typepad.com/">Bob Walsh</a>, author of the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590596013/whitepeaksoft-20/104-8498544-1888714?creative=327641&amp;camp=14573&amp;link_code=as1">Micro-ISV: From Vision to Reality</a> is involved in this project, which says to me it is worth some time to check out what is being offered at Project Glidepath if you are running a small software company.
