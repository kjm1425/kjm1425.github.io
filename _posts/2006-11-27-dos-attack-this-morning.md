title: 'DoS Attack This Morning'
category: business
---

My hosting provider for <a href="http://www.thecave.com/">thecave.com</a> and <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/">whitepeaksoftware.com</a> was hit with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">DoS attack</a> this morning.  As a result the mail and web servers for both domains have been down today since around 9:30 AM Eastern.  The attack seems to be contained as of 2:30 PM Eastern.<br /><br />My apologies to family, friends, and customers who have been trying to reach me by email and to those at thecave.com who have been without email since this morning.
