On the road again tomorrow visiting my two least favorite States, Alabama and Florida.  The 5 day, 5 city tour begins in Birmingham, followed by Jacksonhell.  I don't know why this city rubs me wrong.  It just does.  Wednesday I will be in Fort Lauderdale, Tampa on Thursday, Orlando on Friday, returning to the city Friday night.  Should be a fun week.
