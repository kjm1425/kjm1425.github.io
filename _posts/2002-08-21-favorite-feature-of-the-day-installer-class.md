title: 'Favorite feature of the day: Installer class'

I know I have been weak on the tech note postings but my geek life has been very busy this month.  But for those interested, my favorite .NET feature of the day is Visual Studio.NET's Installer class.  This puppy rocks!  With it you can create custom actions in the setup wizard.  I have created two .MSI files today that update the application config files with database connection settings provided by the user running the setup wizard.  Very nice, I must say...
