My friend Tim is running a marathon at Disney World in January as a member of The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society's Team in Training.  The team is raising funds to help stop leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma and myeloma.  You can make a donation to this great cause and/or check Tim's training status from his new <a href="http://www.active.com/donations/fundraise_public.cfm?key=timlyerla">Tim in Training</a> web page.
