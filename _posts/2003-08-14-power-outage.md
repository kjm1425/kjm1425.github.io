As many may have already heard, New York and other major cities are experiencing a major <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/08/14/power.outage/index.html">power outage</a>.  For family and friends, I am home and fine.  Melanie arrived back in NYC earlier today and was in the process of making it home when the power went out.  I'm not sure if she was on a bus or in the subway.  I hope she had not made it down to the subway just yet as no subways are running and people are stranded in the dark.  I will update the site as soon as I have an update on Melanie.
