I received a DVD containing a database backup from a customer yesterday.  This morning I go to restore the database backup and I quickly realized I can't.  My DVD drive is still packed away, which means it has been over 5 months since I have had to use it.  I didn't realize until now how little I use physical media these days.  Downloads regardless of size are simply better for me.
