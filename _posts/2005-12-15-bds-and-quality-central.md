I finally got my copy of <a href="http://www.borland.com/delphi">Delphi</a> 2006 install and I have started using it day.  I love it and it is a huge improvement over Delphi 2005.<br /><br />Unfortunately the IDE crashed on me, but it did something really cool.  The exception was caught and I was given the option to send the error report to Borland's Quality Central.  Not only that, but if you provide your BDN credentials you can track the report!  How cool is that!<br /><br />I'm happy to see this new level of commitment to quality.
