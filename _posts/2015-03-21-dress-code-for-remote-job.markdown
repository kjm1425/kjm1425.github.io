I came across one of the silliest benefits I've seen for a remote developer job: casual dress code. From the job [posting][1]:

> What’s In It For You
> 
> - Medical and dental benefits
> - Paid vacation and holidays
> - Remote work environment … work where you work best
> - Dynamic and dedicated team
> - Data/Cell (internet) stipend
> - Casual dress code
> - Most of all smart and driven team members that love to collaborate, seek feedback, and improve

I'm not sure I would want to work for a remote company that has a dress code even if it's a casual dress code. I like coding in my pjs on many days, which means I would be in violation of the casual dress code.
