## Final Days: No Snow but Still a Great Time:

The final days in Whistler brought no new snow but still lots of good times.  We rode parts of the mountain that none of us had every seen before.  Places like Whistler Bowl, Doom and Gloom, and others.  The bumps were big, the snow was hard, and the views were spectacular.  Ray took a bad fall in the park and was the only WASTED guest to visit the emergency room this year.  And Melanie, in a very rare moment, decided to see if she could knock down a tree.  Unfortunately for her the tree won.
