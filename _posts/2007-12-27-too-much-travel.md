2007 is winding down and I return home later today from my final trip of the year.  I started a <a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive/2007/01/26/my_trips_in_2007.aspx">travel log</a> this year to see how much I actually travel.  46 trips in total for 2007.  Too much in my opinion.  I hope to see a lot less travel in 2008.<br /><br />The travel log idea is cool, and I plan to do another for 2008 even though I'm hoping for fewer trips.  I wish I had travel logs for past years.  I think the biggest difference I would see for past years compared to 2007 is the diversity of trips.  Vermont and New York City were my most common trips in 2007.  In past years, I traveled more with Melanie on flights she worked and got to spend more time in places such as France.  I made only 1 work trip with her in 2007, to Belgium, and I missed out on trips to France and Ireland this year which really disappoints me.<br /><br />Even though I hope to travel less in 2008, I'm hoping to join Melanie on more work trips (as soon as she returns to work).  And the best part of work trips in 2008 with Melanie will be bringing <a href="http://www.melanieandkirby.com/babyt/">Baby T</a> with us.
