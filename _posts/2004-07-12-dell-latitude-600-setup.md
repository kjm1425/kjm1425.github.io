title: 'Dell Latitude 600 Setup'
category: uncategorized

I received my new Dell Latitude 600 today.  Sweet machine but now it's time to set it up to my liking.  My plan going into it is to setup the host OS with the general tools I need each day such as Eudora Pro, Office 2003, iTunes, and so on.  I will use either VMWare or Virtual PC to host guest OS for my development environments.  I plan to setup the primary user account for each OS with minimum privileges to force me to become even more security minded.
<br />
<br />I'm still not convinced that hosting my development environment in a guest OS is the right choice but I do like the idea of creating a new development environment in a matter of minutes instead of hours.  The big decision I have to make though is whether to use VMWare or Virtual PC.  I have been a VMWare user for some time now but there are some cost benefits for using Virtual PC.  Post a reply if you have an opinion on VMWare versus Virtual.  Meanwhile I'll post more about my setup and configuration experience as I go through the process.
