title: 'Update on Delphi 2007 Order Mess'
category: programming
---

The <a href="http://www.codegear.com/">CodeGear</a> folks are awesome.  They were quick to respond to my <a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive/2007/03/19/why_i_will_never_preorder_from_codegear_again.aspx">pre-order issue</a>.  CodeGear's Loreen Fornshell worked directly with me.  She was able to sort through the mess and correct the mistakes made by Digital River.  It did take a few days but based on my phone calls with Digital River I suspect the delays were caused by DR and not CodeGear.<br /><br />Thanks to CodeGear folks like Loreen my pre-order mess has finally been cleaned up and I should have my license for <a href="http://www.codegear.com/delphi">Delphi 2007</a> later today.  <br /><br />I installed Vista the other day preparing the Delphi 2007.  I don't have much of an opinion on Vista yet because I haven't spent much time playing with it other than to say you better have a beefy machine with lots of RAM if you want the best UI experience.  I ordered more RAM for my laptop so I can run Vista's Aero theme.  I'm not 100% sure if this will meet the minimum requirements needed to use the Aero theme but based on what I have read it should.  I'll know in a couple of days after the new RAM arrives.
