It's starting to get dark outside.  Should be a unique night in the city.  I just might have to walk around a bit.
<br />
<br />Still no word from Melanie.  I'm sure she is safe, but she is probably very annoyed.  And I don't blame her.  I hope she gets home soon.  I really miss her.  If you have heard from her, please send me an e-mail or make a posting on this blog.  Thanks!
