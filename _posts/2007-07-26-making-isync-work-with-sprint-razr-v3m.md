title: 'Making iSync Work With Sprint RAZR V3m'
category: personal

I mentioned earlier today that I had to do a little tweaking to get iSync, running on my MacBook Pro, to work with my Motorola RAZR V3m from Sprint.  Here are the steps I followed to get it working:<ul><br /><li>Download and install latest software updates on the RAZR (Settings &gt; Phone Info &gt; Update Phone SW).</li><br /><li>Download latest <a href="http://www.clockskew.com/forum/">Motorola RAZR V3m iSync Plug-in</a>.</li><br /><li>Created the directory ~/Library/PhonePlugins.</li><br /><li>Extracted the iSync Plug-in to the ~/Library/PhonePlugins directory.</li><br /><li>Launched iSync.</li><br /><li>Followed the iSync instructions for adding the new device.</li><br /></ul>That was it.  It was all goodness for me after that.
