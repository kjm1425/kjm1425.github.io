Amy Hoy wrote the first version of her book [Just Fucking Ship][2] in 24 hours, which is awesome. Along those same lines, [David Smith][1] built an app from start to finish in about 6 hours - also awesome, and he posted this video that shows the entire process.

Both of these, the book and the app, are motivating me to do more faster. I just need to stop letting excuses and fear of not being perfect get in my way.
