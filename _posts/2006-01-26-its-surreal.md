My wife and I have actually moved from New York City to [Salem, Massachusetts](http://www.salemweb.com/).  It's still a bit surreal for us.  As we were driving out of the city yesterday, it didn't feel like we were really leaving.  It felt more like we were making a quick trip and will be returning in a few days.  I think it will hit me in a few days that we're not returning to the city to live.  Then again it might take longer for that to happen since I will be returning to New York next week for a meeting.

The move was the smoothest and easiest move I have ever made.  The movers from Oz Moving were outstanding.  I highly recommend using Oz.

The only problem that occurred yesterday was a flat tire in Connecticut.  The moving truck got a flat on I-95 which delayed their arrival into Salem.  But they did arrive.  We got everything unloaded, and now all that awaits us is the process of unpacking.

Update (September 13, 2012): Oz Moving's web site is http://www.ozmoving.com/. There is no link here because they asked me to remove the link. Seems odd to me that they would make such a request, especially since I'm recommending them, but still, the link has been removed.
