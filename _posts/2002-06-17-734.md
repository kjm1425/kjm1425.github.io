"That's a wrap!" Today's film shoot was the most exciting I have seen on my lovely little street.  It was an all day shoot and there were a handful of stars walking around.  The only one I know by name is <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Leary,+Denis">Denis Leary</a> who always seemed to have a cigarette in his hand.  Now that the street fun is over, I think I will spend a little time snowboarding time on the XBox.
