Melanie and I are flying down to Baltimore today.  I'm so psyched for a number of reasons.  First, I have always wanted to visit Baltimore, the hometown of such <a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive/2002_07_01_archive.aspx#85269605">greats</a> as John Waters and Divine.  Secondly, we are going to visit with Rachel and Fernado another of Melanie's sisters and her sister's boyfriend respectively.
<br />
<br />Another reason for being excited is <a href="http://www.artscape.org">Artscape</a>, which is going on this weekend in Baltimore.  And the best part of Artscape is <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=B4gjteaz04xg7">Buckwheat Zydeco</a> who will be performing on the Sun Stage at 8:45 pm on Saturday.  This guy really gets my butt ah-movin'.
<br />
<br />And finally, I am psyched about the trip to Baltimore because my friends <a href="http://www.kirbyland.net/photoroom/20000317-Jan%20and%20Tim's%20Wedding/P1010023.JPG">Linda and Jeff</a>, originally from St. Louis now living in the DC area, are driving up for the weekend.  It's been two years since I have seen either of them, and I am so excited that we will be meeting up at Artscape.  It's going to be a great weekend!
