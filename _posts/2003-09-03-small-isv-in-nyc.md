Are there no small ISV in NYC other than <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/index.html">Fog Creek</a>?  New York has just about everything including bright technologist.  But it lacks software shops like those found on the Left Coast.  Why is that?  Do they exists but stay underground?  Post a comment or send me an e-mail (kirby at thecavedotcom) if you work for or now of a small ISV in NYC.
