title: 'Laptop verses Xbox'
category: uncategorized

I have developed a ritual for getting through airport security that includes pulling out my laptop before I get in line.  But today was a little different because I am also traveling with my Xbox.  Naturally I expected that I would need to pull out the Xbox from its case but no!  It's not a laptop, it's a game console.
<br />
<br />Okay, so I don't get this.  Why is the Xbox treated differently at airport security than a laptop.  In my opinion, the two are basically the same with regard to hardware.  Both have a hard drive.  Both have a CD/DVD reader.  Both have an ethernet card.  Both have a motherboard, built-in fan...you get the point.  What is so special about a laptop that requires one to remove it from the case while an Xbox can remain in the case.
<br />
<br />The funny part of my experience, though, was the guy reading the Xray monitor.  He could not figure out what it was; the Xbox that is.  I mentioned to him that it was an Xbox.  He joked that they were going to confiscate it, and I joked back that I would give up the laptop before I gave up the Xbox.  Now I have to tell Avanade I need a new laptop.
