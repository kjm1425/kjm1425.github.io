Microsoft's Michael Howard and others have started a <a href="http://nonadmin.editme.com/">wiki</a> on Least-privileged User Account (LUA) security.  Last year I tried running under LUA but found I needed administration privilege for many things, from installing software to writing code.  Needless to say I gave up on my quest to use LUA daily.  But with more information available today such as the <a href="http://nonadmin.editme.com/">nonadmin wiki</a> I think it time for me to try again.  Besides, I want to guarantee that my software installs and runs without a problem under least-privileged user accounts.
