title: 'UI Improvements for SMTP Diagnostics'
category: uncategorized
---

Last week I asked a few friends to send me feedback on SMTP Diagnostics.  I've made good progress on the program since that time and I hope to have the first release available to the public within the next few of weeks.  <br /><br />Today my focus was improving the user interface.  I was able to eliminate the tab control across the top, which I never really liked.  The new interface also has a web look to it that I think improves the overall look.  Take a look at the improvements made and let me know what you think.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.thecave.com/images/blogimages/smtpdiagnosticsnapshot01.JPG">Old user interface</a> versus <a href="http://www.thecave.com/images/blogimages/smtpdiagnosticssnapshot02.gif">new user interface</a>.
