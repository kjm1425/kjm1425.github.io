We took a 3-night/4-day camping trip to Silver Lake in Vermont. We had a great time. Our camp site was on top of a hill surrounded by trees, and the lake was just a short walk down the hill. Pictures from our trip are available <a href="http://photos.thecave.com/Trips/Camping-Trips/Silver-Lake/24392143_pj99p6">here</a>.
