2005 has come and gone, and man was it fast.  2005 was a very interesting year for me.  I learned a lot about running a software business and I have a better idea of what it means to be a self employed computer geek turned aspiring entrepreneur.  I have my success stories, made mistakes, changed directions, lost sleep, and spent more time with my wife.  Here's a brief recap of 2005:<br /><br />Success Stories<br />- Release <a href="http://www.smtpdiagnostics.com/">White Peak Software's first product, SMTPdiagnostics</a>.  <br />- Released 4 custom software solutions for customers.<br />- Elected Chapter President of <a href="http://www.iccanyc.org/">ICCA NYC Metro</a>.<br />- Met target revenue goals.<br />- Became more focus on where I want to take <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/">White Peak Software</a>.<br /><br />Mistakes<br />- Over obligating myself and my time.<br />- Lacking focus for the first half of the year.<br />- Did not release Beta version of Vertigo.<br />- A poor job of networking and keep in touch with customer.<br /><br />So what are my resolutions for 2006?<br /><br />2006 Resolutions<br />- Complete Vertigo version 1.0.<br />- Increase product revenue by at least 60%.<br />- Do a better job of staying in touch with customer.<br />- Do a better job of going to the gym.<br />- And find more ways to spend more time with my wife.
