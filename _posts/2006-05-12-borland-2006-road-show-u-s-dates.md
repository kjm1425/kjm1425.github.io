Registration for the [Borland 2006 Road Show](http://208.109.7.163/html/borland_inside/landing.htm) is now open for the U.S. dates.  I have reserved my spot for the June 8 NYC event.

\[Not to worry Darren and Jeff, I will be back in time to pick you guys up at the Boston Logan airport that night.  Actually I will probably schedule my flight so I arrive to Boston around the same time as you guys.\]
