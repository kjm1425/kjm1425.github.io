If you are interested in playing with Mono running under a Linux distribution but you don't want to go through the trouble of setting up a Linux machine (or virtual machine), check out <a href="http://www.monoppix.com/">Monoppix</a>.  Monoppix is a bootable CD image with the Knoppix distribution of Linux and Mono pre-installed.  Pop in the CD, re-boot the computer and you are off and running with nothing to install on your hard drive.  It runs completely off the CD.
