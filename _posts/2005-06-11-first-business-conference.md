I'm spending the weekend in Atlanta at my first business related conference.  Conferences I have attended in the past were technology related such as the Borland Developer Conference and Microsoft PDC so I wasn't sure what to expect.<br /><br />I definitely see a difference beyond the topics at this conference compared to the developer conferences I've attended in the past.  For one, attendees at a business conference tend to dress better than the t-shirt and jeans geek crowd of dev cons.  Another difference is the ease of networking.  It is very easy to approach people at the event.  I have already met a number of people, which makes the event more enjoyable.  It's comforting feeling like you are surrounded by friends.
