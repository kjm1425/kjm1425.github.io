<b>Attention @thecave.com E-mail Users</b>: There was a serious problem with the SmarterMail today that forced my new hosting provider to reset the passwords of all the e-mail accounts.  I have reset the password to the value provided in the e-mail I sent out last week.  If for some reason you do not know your password please reach out to me by e-mail or phone and I will get you going again.
<br />
<br />I apologize for the outage this afternoon.  The timing could not have been worse.  Less than one week with the new provider and already one serious problem.  Hopefully this will not be a sign of things to come.  And in defense of the new hosting provider, the support staff reacted quickly to the problem and helped ensure no loss of e-mails.
<br />
<br />Again, sorry for the problem and please let me know if you have any other problems.
