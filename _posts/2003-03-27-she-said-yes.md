I just returned from Nice with Melanie, and we have big news!  **We're engaged!!!**  I asked her to marry me and she said yes.  Well, actually she said "Of course."  But I didn't hear it so she had to yes again.  More details to come very soon.

Meanwhile, check out the new photos in the [gallery](gallery.aspx) including St. Patty's Day fun, Nice, and [Saint Paul de Vence](http://www.provenceweb.fr/e/alpmarit/stpaul/stpaul.htm).
