Yesterday was a 16 hour work day for me.  It was a long day but a good end to a <a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive/2007/04/20/killink_version_10_rc_1_is_ready_for_download.aspx">long, busy week</a>.  However I made one last minute mistake last night.  I posted the new release of <a href="http://www.killink.com/">Killink CSV</a> but I forgot to update the <a href="http://www.killink.com/download.aspx">download page</a> with links to the new download files.  My apologies to anyone who tried downloading the program in the last 12 hours.  <br /><br />I updated the <a href="http://www.killink.com/download.aspx">download page</a> this morning, so all is well now.
