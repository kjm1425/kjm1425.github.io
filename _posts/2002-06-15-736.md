Found interesting community web site called <a href="http://www.advogato.com/">Advogato</a>, the free software developer's advocate. The goal of the site is to serve as a community resource for free software developers around the world, as well as a research testbed for work on group trust metrics.  The site provides weblogs for site members, which I found most interesting and has introduced me to more like minded individuals.
