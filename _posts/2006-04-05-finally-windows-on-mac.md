CNet news is reporting that <a href="http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-6057856.html?tag=nl.e589">Apple has announced Boot Camp</a>, a new software package that makes it possible to run Microsoft Windows on the new Intel-based Macs.  How awesome is that!  It's one step closer to making me want to buy a Mac.  Now what would be really awesome and close the deal for me is to have "Devco" create a Delphi compiler for the Mac OS and make it easy for me to port my VCL applications to Mac.
