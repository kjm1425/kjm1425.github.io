Spent the weekend with Melanie and most of her family in Killington.  The snow was great.  Saturday we rode Killington.  It was very chilly with temps in the single digits and wind chill well below zero.  The close to 50 mph wind gusts were a lot of fun and almost pushed me over a few times.

<br />We went to Pico on Sunday.  Less wind and it felt a bit warmer.  But best of all was the snow conditions, which were beyond great!  I felt like I was riding out west at times.  The ungroomed blacks and glades were the places to be.  It was the perfect primer to my upcoming Whistler trip.
