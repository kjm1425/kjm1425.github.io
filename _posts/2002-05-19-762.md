This weekend's geek out weekend involved setting up a new remote development environment for myself.  My plan was to roll out a hosted version of <a href="http://www.cvsnt.org/">CVS</a> (Concurrent Versions System) with secure access via SSH.  I used <a href="http://www.networksimplicity.com/openssh/">OpenSSH on Windows</a> from Network Simplicity, which was easy to install and configure.  OpenSSH also includes SCP, a secure copy program, which I am now using to make backups of important information from my laptop to my file server.  Totally sweet, I must say.
<br />
<br />CVSNT was a bit of a challenge compared to OpenSSH but I did get it installed and running.  The final step was to provide remote access to my CVS repository through a secure tunnel using SSH.  This has proven to be very challenge and I have yet to finish this goal.  I have search the Net over and have learned many others have had the same problems.  This is preventing me from building the desired remote development environment, which means I must continue using VPN access to my Visual Source Safe repository.
<br />
<br />Not all is lost though.  I learned a lot about security, secure access, PKI, OpenSSH and such.  And I have a easy to use, fast, secure process for backing up files from my laptop.  I am not giving up on the challenge either.  I will try again in a couple of weeks when I have more time.
