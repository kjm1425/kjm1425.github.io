"The software business is picking up regionally across the country", as noted per CEO of White Peak's <a href="http://www.intersoftdevelopment.com/">Cleveland database developers</a> partner firm, which has seen software development and consulting requests easily double during the past 3 months in the Cleveland, Ohio region.  Requests have been pouring in from small, mid, and large firms alike.  The most sought after technology skills have been Access, Microsoft SQL Server 2000 and 2005, and .NET recently.
