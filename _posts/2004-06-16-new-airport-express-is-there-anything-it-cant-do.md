title: 'New AirPort Express: Is there anything it can''t do?'
category: uncategorized

Apple's new <a href="http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/">AirPort Express</a> sounds simply amazing.  It can act as a wireless bridge, provides wireless access to USB printers, and play music broadcasted wirelessly from your computer.  The device fits in the palm of your hand and it has a built-in AC adaptor meaning no cables or power supply.  This little puppy will be great to take on the road too.  You can connect it to the hotel's ethernet and access the Internet wirelessly.  Or use it at the home of friends and family who have broadband Internet access but no wireless access point.  I might have to buy one once Apple starts shipping it.<br /><br /><br />
