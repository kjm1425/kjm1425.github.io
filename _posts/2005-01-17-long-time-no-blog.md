Although it is probably silly to apologize for not posting a new entity in over a month, I still feel compelled.  So I apologize for not posting a new entity in over a month.
<br />
<br />Whew, glad that's over.
<br />
<br />As you can probably guess, I have been busy over the last month.  I wish I could say I had been spending all my time snowboarding and playing Xbox but I can't.  I've only spent a small amount of time on the slopes and behind the S-controller.  And I've been catching up on episodes of Aqua Teen Hunger Focus and Warren Miller TV too.  But the majority of my time has been with White Peak Software.
<br />
<br />I have been doing some exciting work over the last month which I hope to post more about in the coming days and weeks.  For instance, I finally got around to learning how to use the MSI NAntContrib task as part of a build script, and I've been working with the PropertyGrid included in the .NET Framework.
<br />
<br />All these ideas floating in my head, I just need to find some time to share them with others.
