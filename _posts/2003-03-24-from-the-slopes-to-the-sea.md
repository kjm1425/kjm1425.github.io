Melanie and I just returned from a great weekend in Killington.  The snow was perfect, soft and fun.  Spring time conditions.  I had some of my best runs of the season over the weekend.
<br />
<br />We're back in NYC for only a short time.  Melanie flies out to Nice today and I have decided to join her.  I need to see how she works on these international flights.  I can't wait to start pushing the call button just to get her attention.  We're back in NYC on Thursday.
