I am happy to announce that I have been elected President of the <a href="http://www.iccanyc.org/">ICCA NYC METRO Chapter</a>.  I will be working with an excellent group of business professionals who make up the rest of the Chapter Board of Directors.  Together we will continue to grow the Chapter and find ways to provide greater value to our members as started by the previous Board of Directors.<br /><br />While this opportunity will present a new set of challenges for me, I'm excited by the fact I will be pushed beyond my comfort zone in certain areas which will help me improve my own soft skills.  Thank you to the members who voted for me and to those who expressed their confidence in my abilities to be effective in this new role.
