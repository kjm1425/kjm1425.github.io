We have returned from our Charlotte visit.  It was a great time and really nice to see Dave and meet the little woman (no pun intended) Meg.  We ate at some very good restaurants...Dave and Meg knows how to pick 'em.  And Saturday night's live sketch comedy at <a href="http://www.theperch.com/">The Perch</a> left all of us with our sides hurting.  "Talkin' Baby.  That's crazy."  Thanks Dave and Meg for the invite!
