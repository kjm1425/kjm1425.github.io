I re-discovered <a href="http://www.vmware.com/">VMWare</a> today and I have to say the latest version totally kicks butt!  I'm finally sportin' a new laptop with lots of RAM and tons of hard drive space so I thought it was time to look at VMWare again.  The latest workstation release, version 3.2, was very easy to install.  And setting up a new virtual machine has never been easier.  I had Windows 2000 Advance Server up and running in a VM session in under 45 minutes.  No re-partitioning of the hard drive is required.  All VM sessions are stored in a collection of files.  Best of all, I can archive a clean install and restore it later after I have totally screwed up the environment.  My next step is to setup an environment running Java, Apache, etc so I can demo .NET/J2EE interop.  All developers should have the freedom of VMWare on their workstation.
