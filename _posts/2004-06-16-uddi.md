A friend pointed me to <a href="http://www.bindingpoint.net/">BindingPoint</a>, which is an XML web services directory.  I did a quick search on <a href="http://www.bindingpoint.net/services.aspx?tag=srch&amp;val=snow+report&amp;x=0&amp;y=0">"snow report"</a> and found my snow report web service.  I checked out the service description that I setup in UDDI over a year ago and ran the quick test from BindingPoint.  It brought back memories of my <a href="http://www.uddi.org/">UDDI</a> and Web services work I did last year.  And I still think UDDI rocks!<br /><br /><br />
