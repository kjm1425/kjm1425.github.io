Web server controls technology in ASP.NET is a great advancement for web application developers.  However, it is not the only way and NOT always the right way to implement web page features.  There is still a need for client-side scripting and HTML controls.  Not every page needs to perform a post back and a form that runs at server is not always needed.
<br />
<br />It seems that some ASP.NET developers have forgotten some of the lessons learned with ASP and how to implement user friendly web pages.  It seems some of these developers have forgotten that your can embedded script within the HTML inside the ASPX file.  Or that client-side scripting can enhance the user experience.
<br />
<br />Web server controls are great, useful, and simplify web application development.  But it is not the only set of tools available to the developer.  ASP.NET developers need to remember this.
