Lately I have been looking at all things web services and UDDI.  I attended the <a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/conference/">Web Service DevCon</a> in Portland, OR, which totally rocked! Chris Sells and Tim Ewald did an outstanding job bringing together some of the best minds in the industry for this 2-day conference.  And today I looked at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows.NETserver/developers/default.asp">Microsoft UDDI Services</a>.
<br />
<br />Microsoft UDDI Services appears to be nothing more than an ASP.NET application built on top of a SQL Server database, so I am at a loss as to why Microsoft requires Windows .Net Server to run UDDI Services.  I suspect it has something to do with a marketing decision.
<br />
<br />Negativity aside, Microsoft has done a nice implementation with UDDI Services. The web interface is nice, maybe even a bit better than Microsoft own public UDDI node web site.  And the SOAP interface to the UDDI registry worked in all my test.  I have a console app written in C# that uses <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/nhp/Default.asp?contentid=28001204">Microsoft UDDI SDK</a> for .NET.  I have been using the console app to test the UDDI SDK against Microsoft and IBM's public test UDDI nodes.  Today I ran the app against a locally installed instance of UDDI Services and the program ran without a problem.  This is what I expected to see, but rarely do with other software packages.  Nice job Microsoft.
