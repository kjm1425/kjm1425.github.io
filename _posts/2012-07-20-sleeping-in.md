Rowan has recently been sleeping later into the mornings. This is great because Melanie and I both prefer sleeping in as well. I remember when Rowan first started sleeping through the night. He would wake up at 5:30 in the morning to start his day. I used to say, if only he would sleep until 6 am. And of course he did start sleeping until 6 am over time. When that happened, I starter saying, if only he would sleep until 6:30 am. As he slept later, I continued saying to myself, sleep until 7 am. Then it was 7:30 am. Then 8 am.

He is now consistently sleeping until sometime between 8 and 9 am each morning, and I'm loving it. But as the saying goes, all good things must come to an end. Lucky for me that end doesn't come for another year when the kid start kindergarten. Until that time, I'm going to enjoy the extra sleep.
