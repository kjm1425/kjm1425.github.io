Last week I went to a Yankee's game.  I got to sit by 3rd base only 9 rows behind the dugout.  But I forgot to take the camera.<br /><br />Then Saturday Melanie and I went to the <a href="http://www.usopen.org/">U.S. Open</a>.  Even though there were some rain delays during the day we got to see some matches at night.  But again, I forgot to take the camera.<br /><br />Monday we returned to the U.S. Open.  Actually twice in one day.  Nothing but rain.  Rain, rain, rain.  We saw only 5 quick games.  Not even a full set.  But this time I remembered to bring the camera.  Pictures are in the <a href="gallery.aspx">gallery</a>.  Enjoy.<br /><br />
