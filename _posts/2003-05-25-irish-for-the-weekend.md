Melanie and I just returned from East Durham, NY in the Catskills.  Christine and the Early family invited us up for the 26th annual East Durham Irish Festival, and for the second year in a row I had a blast.  The music was great especially the Young Dublins from LA and NYC's McCabe.  And as always, Lizzy Joe's shepherd's pie was delicious.  But the funniest moment was when Christine grabbed the micro from the stage and shouted "Black 47 sucks...".

<br />Thanks Christine for a great weekend.  I can't wait until next year.
