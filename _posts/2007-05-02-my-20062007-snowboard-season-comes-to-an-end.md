Monday night my wife and I made a last minute decision to make a quick trip to <a href="http://www.killington.com/">Killington</a> for one last day of snowboarding.  Well, skiing for her.  We hit the slopes yesterday and had a blast.  But our 2006/2007 season has officially come to an end.  <br /><br />This season turned out to be a great season for me despite the rough start.  By mid-January I had far fewer days riding then I had hoped for or expected.  New England wasn't getting the early season snow it typically does.  But in the end I got 32 days of riding and a few of those days included some of the best riding experiences I have ever had.  Also, I can now say I have snowboarded in May and I snowboarded at least once a month for 7 consecutive months.  Now if I can just get 40+ days next season...
