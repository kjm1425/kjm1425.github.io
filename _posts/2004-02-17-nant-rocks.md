I have been working on making an automated build environment for a customer project and I have to say <a href="http://nant.sf.net/">NAnt</a> simply rocks!  I am able to do some many things with it should as touch redist files, send e-mails on success and failure events, and build different targets.  Later I will try posting complete details on the continuous integration environment I have built using NAnt, NUnit, CVS, VMWare and more.<br /><br /><br />
