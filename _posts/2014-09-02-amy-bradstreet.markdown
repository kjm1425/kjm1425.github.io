I learned this morning that a friend of mine, Amy Bradstreet, was [murdered][news] last night by her boyfriend and father of her kids. I’m left without words. I’m sad, stunned, stocked, and some what angry. Amy was one of the most fun loving people on this earth, and she did not deserve to die this way. My heart goes out to Amy's family.

You will be missed, Amy.
