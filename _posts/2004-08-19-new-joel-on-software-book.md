Joel Spolsky of Joel on Software fame has published a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=whitepeaksoft-20&amp;path=tg/detail/-/1590593898">new book</a> called "Joel on Software: And on Diverse and Occasionally Related Matters That Will Prove of Interest to Software Developers, Designers, and Managers, and to Those Who, Whether by Good Fortune or Ill Luck, Work with Them in Some Capacity."  That's some title.  According to Joel's e-mail, the book consist of 45 "timeless" articles from his site.  Not much new content but sometimes a book is preferred over a web page.
