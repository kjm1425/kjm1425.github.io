My Xbox died a couple of weeks ago on <a href="http://www.wastedboarding.com/http://www.wastedboarding.com/wastedblog/home.aspx">my trip</a> to Whistler.  Melanie is working this weekend and I have to say I am missing the game play.  So I finally called the Xbox support number to find out my opinions.  The console I have needs repair work which costs $100, shipping included.  A new Xbox will cost $200.  The difference is I can pick up a new Xbox today but it will be a few weeks before my get back my repaired Xbox.
<br />
<br />A part of me wants to repair the box I have mainly because I am close to finishing Transworld Snowboarding.  It's the only game I have that does not let me copy my saved games to a memory card.  So if I want to continue the game, I have to repair the box.  But I am jonzen to play.  And starting over is not really a big deal either.
<br />
<br />So what should I do?  Should I repair or replace my Xbox?  What would you do?
