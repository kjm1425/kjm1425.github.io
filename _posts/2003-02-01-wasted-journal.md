As you may already know, I am heading out to Whistler for a two week vacation.  I will be making daily or almost daily posting about the trip to <a href="http://www.wastedboarding.com/wastedblog/home.aspx">WASTEDBoarding.com</a> site as well as this site.  Hopefully it will not be too confusing posting the same message at two sites.  We'll see how it goes.
