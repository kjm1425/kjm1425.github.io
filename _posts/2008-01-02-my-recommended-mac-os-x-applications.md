I have been a Mac OS X users for 6 months now and I love it.  It is doubtful I will ever return to a Windows only machine so I thought it fitting to list the OS X software I use regularly.<ul><br /><li><a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/mail.html">Mail.app</a>, which comes with OS X, is a powerful email program that allows me to manage the many, many mail messages I receive daily.</li><br /><li><a href="http://www.blogger.com/www.apple.com/ical/">iCal</a> is another handy program that comes with OS X.  iCal allows me to manage multiple calendars.</li><br /><li><a href="http://www.spanningsync.com/">Spanning Sync</a> synchronizes my iCal calendars with Google Calendars.</li><br /><li><a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/300.html#addressbook">Address Book</a>, also free with OS X, is a nice address book manager.</li><br /><li><a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/">Fusion</a> by VMware is the one piece of software that convinced me to try OS X.  While I love OS X I still must use Windows on a daily basis.  Fusions allows me to run Windows hosted as a virtual machine within OS X.</li><br /><li><a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</a> is my preferred web browser. Safari is nice and I use it from time to time.  But Firefox is the browser I use most often.</li><br /><li><a href="http://www.adiumx.com/">Adium</a> is a friendly chat program supporting AOL, Yahoo, Messenger, Google Talk, and who knows what else.  I like iChat, which comes with OS X, but I don't use it often due to its lacking support for IM services such as Messenger.</li><br /><li><a href="http://www.apple.com/iphoto/">iPhoto</a> is my favorite application in the iLife suite.  I enjoy taking pictures and I currently use iPhoto to manage all my digital pictures, a collection that is quickly approaching 7,000 pictures.</li><br /><li><a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/">iLife '08</a> is another reason I decided to switch to the Mac.  Making movies, burning DVDs, and managing my digital photos was never this easy in the Windows world.</li><br /><li><a href="http://cord.sourceforge.net/">CoRD</a> is a remote desktop client.  I use it often to RDP into other Windows machines on my network.</li><br /><li><a href="http://www.videolan.org/">VLC</a> is a freeware media player.</li><br /><li><a href="http://www.panic.com/unison/">Unison</a> is a nice newsgroup reader.  I  prefer the user interface from Agent but it is not available for OS X.</li><br /><li><a href="http://www.opencommunity.co.uk/vienna2.php">Vienna</a> is an open source RSS feed reader.</li><br /><li><a href="http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/">SuperDuper</a> is my preferred backup software.  Easy to use, and powerful enough to make the types of backups I want.</li><br /></ul>
