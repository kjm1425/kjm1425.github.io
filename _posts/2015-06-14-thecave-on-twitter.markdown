My friend Uli [asked][1]:

> Do you have a Twitter feed that lets me know when you post something new?

It only took me a month, but I finally have a Twitter account for thecave. Follow [@thecave_com][2] on Twitter if you want to know when I post something new to this blog. And as always you can subscribe to the [RSS feed][3] if you prefer feed readers over Twitter.

## The Technical How To

There are a few different ways to automate the process of posting a link on Twitter when you publish a new blog post. [Twitter Feed][4] is one service I tried. It is fast and easy to setup, and it includes options such as including the title, description, or title and description in the tweet. Even though Twitter Feed is a cinch to setup, I decided to go with [If This Then That (IFTTT)][5] instead.

Using IFTTT create a new recipe. Select *Feed* for the trigger and *Twitter* for the action. Be sure to connect your Twitter account to the IFTTT if you have not already done so. And that's it. Next time you make a blog post, IFTTT will update your Twitter account with the title and link to the post.

And thanks [@uliwitness][6] for suggesting I do this.
