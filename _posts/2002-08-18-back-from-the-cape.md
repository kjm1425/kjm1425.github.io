Melanie and I just returned from our first trip to Cape Cod.  Rachel and Dana, our wonderful host for the weekend, invited us up for the weekend.  We stayed in a cute cottage owned by Dana's parents.  This private community was neat.  All the cottages look like miniature houses.  We spent Saturday and Sunday out on the beach...Melanie getting more tan and me, well, I stayed white with my SPF 50.  The highlight of the weekend was me finally beating Melanie at miniature golf.  Yep, it's true.  She was not playing at her typical level and I was in the zone, if you can believe that.

<br />I must say visiting the Cape was very relaxing.  And I hope Rachel and Dana invite us up again.
