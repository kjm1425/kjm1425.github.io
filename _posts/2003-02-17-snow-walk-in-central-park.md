Melanie and I decided to enjoy the snow from today's blizzard with a walk through Central Park.  The park was full of people enjoying the weather; from snowboarders riding the short hills to cross country skiers out for a bit of exercise to kids riding sleds, we saw it all.  Hopefully I will get some pictures posted very soon.
