I was lucky enough to return to New York City at the tail end of the latest Noreastern to hit the Northeast part of the country.  Many flights were cancelled in and out of NYC airports but the plane I was on was one of the lucky ones allowed to land on the snow plowed runway.  Yeah! I am finally home for a few days.
<br />
<br />But the funny thing is that I was hoping to ride my freebord, which has still not seen the concret.  Guess I will have to wait a few more days freebording the streets of New York.  And I tell you I am jonesin' to stand sideways and ride something.  So much so I was seen riding a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004S1SU/ref=cm_bg_f_1/102-4319086-5639357">lawn buddy cart</a> on the hill behind my aunt's house in Mississippi on Christmas afternoon.  What fun!
