We're back from <a href="http://www.sundayriver.com/">Sunday River</a>, Maine where the snow was better than expected two out of the three days we were there.  Sunday River is a nice place to visit and we will definitely go back some day.  The trails are a lot of fun with lots of rolling slopes.  The black diamond runs are not too steep and the double blacks, while steeper, are typically short.  They make a lot of snow there when needed and do an excellent job grooming the trails.  There's lots to explore and a few different terrain parks, although more park than I can handle.  All and all, Sunday River was a great place for Melanie and I to bring in the new year.
