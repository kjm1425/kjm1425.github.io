It started yesterday with <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/051006/65245.html?.v=1">Boz Elloy</a> then <a href="http://www.lemanix.com/nick/">Nick Hodges</a>.  Nick went one step further by suggesting all Delphi developers <a href="http://www.lemanix.com/nick/archive/2005/10/06/3140.aspx">extend thanks to the Delphi R&amp;D;, QA, and Doc teams</a> for creating a <a href="http://www.borland.com/delphi">great development tool</a>.  And now I would like to join in.<br /><br />I like to give a huge Thanks to the Delphi team at Borland.  Delphi has been my favorite development language and tool since the time (9 years ago or so) when I was first introduced to it by my friend Tom.  And while I also work with other languages, Delphi remains my tool of choice whenever possible especially for building desktop applications.
