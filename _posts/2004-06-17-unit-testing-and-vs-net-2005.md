I <a href="http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2004/06/12/1379.aspx">agree</a> with Scott.  Unit Testing support should be included with all versions of Visual Studio 2005 and not just with Team System.  However, I am not sure I agree with the unit testing support using a new framework developed by Microsoft.  <a href="http://www.nunit.org/">NUnit</a> is here today and works with all released versions of the .NET Framework.  And I am sure support for version 2 of the .NET Framework will be included in NUnit once Microsoft has released it.<br /><br />I doubt many of my customers will be ready to move to VS.NET 2005 and the .NET Framework 2.0 when it is released, but I will still be developing solutions for them.  And I will continue to provide unit tests for custom written production code.  So while I agree that all versions of Visual Studio.NET 2005 should include support for unit testing, I would like to see stronger support for NUnit and not some new testing framework.  This will help ease the migration to the new tool and framework.<br /><br /><br />
