Melanie and I do live a charmed life.  As we left Nice, France this morning I saw one of the most beautiful views of the snow covered French Alps I have ever seen.  I was kicking myself for not having my camera on hand.  But the charmed life doesn't end there.  Once we arrive in New York we are driving up to the green mountains of Vermont.  Funny, the first real snow I have seen this season was this morning flying over the Alps but the first real snow I will ride on is in Killington, Vermont only 24 hours later.  Yes indeed, a charmed life.
