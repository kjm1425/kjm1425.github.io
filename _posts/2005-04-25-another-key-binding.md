title: 'Another Key Binding'

I just discovered another useful key binding in the Delphi IDE.  Alt+\[Up Arrow\] will take you to the declaration of the token and Alt+\[Left Arrow\] will return you to the previous position.  These two bindings are very useful for navigating code.  For instance, you can place the cursor on the name of a method anywhere in code, press Alt+\[Up Arrow\] to go to the implementation of the method, then press Alt+\[Left Arrow\] to return back to the original cursor position.

The old VB IDE did something similar with F7 and Ctrl+F7 (I think those were the bindings but I could be wrong).  Unfortunately the VS.NET does not have bindings for these, which I have sorely missed.
