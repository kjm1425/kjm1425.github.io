Last month I mentioned <a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive/2007/04/16/powerpoint_2007_and_outlook_2003_dont_play_nice_together.aspx">Windows automatic update was maxing out the CPU on my computer after I installed PowerPoint 2007</a>.  It seems I'm not the only one dealing with the annoying issue.  Here is a suggested workaround to the <a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/blogs/mowgreen/index.php?s=3e9ba5023518c8b34453138b5ab57024&amp;showentry=1071">infamous svchost issue</a>.<br /><br />Also, here is <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/microsoft.public.windowsupdate/browse_thread/thread/228d22046d54d430/40670938071f33bd?lnk=st&amp;q=wuauclt%2Fsrvchost+at+100%25+today&amp;rnum=1">another newsgroup thread</a> talking about the issue that might be helpful to some.<br /><br /><span style="color:red">Update:</span> The workaround mentioned above does not prevent wuauclt and svchost from using 100% of the CPU but it does make the computer responsive again.  Prior to applying the workaround the computer would be unusable for long periods of time.
