## Day 6: Return to Blackcomb:

Today was the return to Blackcomb.  The snow was much better than the other day especially in the afternoon.  Blackcomb Glacier was very nice and the views were incredible.  7th Heaven was the place to be this afternoon.  The snow was soft from the warm temps and sun.  But we are too exhausted to take advantage of the conditions with multiple runs.

There's nothing else new to report.  Sunny, warm weather and still no new snow.  Jonesboro, Arkansas has got more new snow this week than Whistler.  And the forecast calls for more of the same sunny weather through at least Monday.
