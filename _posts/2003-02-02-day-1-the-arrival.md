## Day 1: The Arrival:

Our day started early this morning in Vancouver.  We loaded the SUV with our gear and started the drive up to Whistler.  With little to no traffic, we made it to Whistler within an hour and a half.  We dropped off the car and headed directly to the Longhorn.  6 pitchers or so later we checked into the condo.  This year's condo is really sweet with a view over the pedestrian walkway.  Diner at the fav Caramba's for woodfire penne and 3-cheese macaroni.  Today is all about Xbox and chillin' out before hitting the slopes tomorrow morning.

There are some fun photos of Day 1 in the [gallery](http://www.wastedboarding.com/wastedblog/gallery.aspx) including my expert pass for the terrain park...highest level baby.  Not that I will use it but it's cool to have.
