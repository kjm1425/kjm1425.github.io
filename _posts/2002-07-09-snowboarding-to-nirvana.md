"I was in one of the most beautiful places in all the world, the Himalayan mountains.  Several months before, in my endless quest for the perfect snow, I had left my home in America and traveled by plane to Nepal with my two snowboards, to have the ultimate experience in snowboarding."

<br />This is the first paragraph of Frederick Lenz's book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312181795/qid=1026221758/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/002-4458947-9779201">Snowboarding to Nirvana</a>.  I read this paragraph and had to buy the book.  I can't wait to start reading the book.
