Ever feel stupid?  Well I do right now.  Last week I turned on my TV and poof...no picture.  So I pressed the power button on the remote a few more times.  Still no picture.  Next I tried the power button on the TV unit and still no picture.  The TV is toasted I thought
<br />
<br />Not wanting to spend the money on a new TV, I decided to call for home service.  75 bucks for a home visit!  But that is cheaper than a new TV.  So after going almost a week without a TV or <a href="http://www.xbox.com/ampedfreestylesnowboarding/default.htm?cs_catalog=cat%2dus">Amped!</a> for Xbox for that matter, I scheduled an appointment for a service visit between 1 and 5 pm.  Don't you just love those service windows.  5:15 and no technician.  Figures!  So I call.  He is running late and will be here within an hour.  No problem.  I am working anyway.
<br />
<br />Finally the tech arrives.  I buzz him into the building.  We get ready to move the TV to the floor so he can take off the back of the set.  I unplug the TV before the move and hear what sounds like the TV turning off!  "No!" I think, "Don't tell me all I needed to do was unplug the TV!"  We move the TV to the floor but before the tech removes the back off the set I plug it back in.  And guess what.  The damn thing turned on!
<br />
<br />75 bucks to have a tech watch me unplug and plug in the TV.  Now talk about feeling stupid.
