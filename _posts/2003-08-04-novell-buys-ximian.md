[The Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/32145.html): "Novell is beefing up its Linux play with the cash acquisition of Ximian. The company has confirmed that it will continue to support Ximian-sponsored Mono and GNOME open source projects."

I'm interested to see if this becomes a positive move for Mono.
