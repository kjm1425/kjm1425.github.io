I'm making more of an effort to check the log files from my web sites.  During a recent review I noticed a number of hits coming in for the search term "bill gates house".  I investigated this more today and was surprised by what I found.<br /><br />Go to <a href="http://images.search.yahoo.com/">Yahoo's Image Search</a> and search on the phrase "<a href="http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/images;_ylt=A9iby6AQCldGhgwAhEeLuLkF?ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=sfp&amp;p=bill+gates+house">bill gates house</a>".  The 4th image across the top links back to a blog posting I made 3 years go about a <a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive/2004/05/07/usnewscom_technology_bill_gates_house.aspx">virtual tour of Bill Gates's house</a>.<br /><br />The funny part in all of this is that the image displayed on the Yahoo Image Search is NOT Bill Gates's House.  It is the <a href="http://www.whistlerblackcomb.com/groups/roundhouse/Index.htm">Round House Lodge</a> on top of <a href="http://www.whistlerblackcomb.com/">Whistler mountain</a>.  But apparently because my site is listed as number 4 people come to the blog posting in hopes of seeing Bill Gates's house.  <br /><br />Sorry to disappoint but that picture is not Bill Gates's house.
