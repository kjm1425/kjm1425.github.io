eWeek.com reports <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1922384,00.asp?kc=ewnws020806dtx1k0000599">Borland to Divest Dev Tools with Segue Buyout</a>.  This is definitely not a move I expected from Borland's new CEO Tod Nielsen.  Borland made the announcement yesterday saying it <a href="http://www.borland.com/us/company/news/press_releases/2006/02_08_06_borland_acquires_segue_software.html">plans to seek a buyer for the Borland IDE product lines</a>, which include Delphi, C++ Builder, C# Builder, JBuilder, InterBase, Kylix, and more.<br /><br />Although I didn't expect it, I think it is a good move.  Borland's focus the last couple of years has been on its ALM business, which is no interest to me.  The idea that a new spin-off company will be created that will focus on development tools such as Delphi sounds like the right move to me.  And I was happy to read that <a href="http://blogs.borland.com/davidi/archive/2006/02/08/23013.aspx">David Intersimone, aka David I, will be joining the new dev tool company</a>.
