A friend emailed me asking if I'm around in two weekends. He wants to visit me in Stowe and do a little riding together. I haven't seen this friend in years, and it will be great to catch up ago. The problem is, I discovered I'm busy every weekend through the end of March. Turns out, when you live in a ski town, lots of people want to come for a visit. 

So if you want to visit me in Stowe, and you want to ride together, it'll have to be during the weekday or a weekend towards the end of March beginning of April. 

And in case you're wondering, the skiing and riding in Stowe has been superb recently.
