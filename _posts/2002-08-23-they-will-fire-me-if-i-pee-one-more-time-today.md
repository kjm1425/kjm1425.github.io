Get this crap...<a href="http://www.courier-journal.com/localnews/2002/08/21/ke082102s261927.htm">Daily news from Louisville, Kentucky and Southern Indiana from courier-journal.com</a> The Jim Beam bourbon-making plant in Bullitt County is disputing a Kentucky Labor Cabinet citation involving toilet breaks for the plant's bottlingline workers.
<br />
<br />Under a policy implemented in October, line workers at the Jim Beam Brands Co. plant may use the restroom only during lunch and two other scheduled daily breaks, one before lunch and one after. They also are allowed one unscheduled toilet break per day, and can be disciplined for taking more, starting with a warning and escalating to dismissal after six incidents.
