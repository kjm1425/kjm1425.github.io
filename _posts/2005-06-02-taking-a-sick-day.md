Regrettably I need to take a sick day today.  I have been feeling under the weather all week and I have been running a high fever since yesterday afternoon.  I'm going to spend the day resting to get over this bug.<br /><br />I will try to return all calls and e-mails by the end of the day or by tomorrow morning at the latest.
