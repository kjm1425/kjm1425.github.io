Work on Swirl has started up again.  For those readers who have forgotten, Swirl is the code name for White Peak Software's soon to be released <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/">Web service debugger and testing program</a>.  I missed the planned milestone of having the first beta release out by the end of May due to other customer demands.  Can't blame a guy for needing to make money from time to time, right?<br /><br />As I'm working through preparing Swirl for the first beta release, something occurred to me.  I really don't like the WSDL parser I wrote.  It works mostly.  I say mostly because there is still a bug or two left in the parser.  But the reason I don't like it is not because there are a few bugs but because the code is nasty and hard to maintain.  I think it is time to take a step back and refactor the WSDL parser into something better.  This of course will delay the beta release even more but it's worth the delay in the long run.
