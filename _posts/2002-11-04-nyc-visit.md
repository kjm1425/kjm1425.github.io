Melanie and I decided to do something different this weekend.  We decided to stay in New York City.  Yep, instead of waits in airports, short jogs to transfer planes, and being violated by airport security personnel we decided to "visit" New York City.

<br />The weekend included such fun as CD shopping, buying new clothes, walking around the Village and Chelsea, and drinks with friends.  We went to a friend's birthday party, and Melanie and I finally made it back to Kush, our favorite Lower East Side Moroccan lounge.  But the highlight of the weekend was watching the St Louis Blues whoop up the NY Rangers at the Garden for a 3-2 victory.  And even in hockey New York fans still boo their own team.   We ended the evening with dinner, wine, and jazz at a West Village restaurant appropriately called NYC.
