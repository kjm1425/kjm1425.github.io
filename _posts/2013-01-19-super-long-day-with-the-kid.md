Melanie's out of town enjoying some quality vacation time with one of her girlfriends leaving Rowan and me in Salem to enjoy some quality father son time. We made the most of it today, which has turned into a super long day. 

Rowan woke me up at 4 AM looking for his blanket and Blue Doggie. Naturally, I couldn't go back to sleep so I did some work starting at 4:30 AM. Rowan woke up at 8 AM, so I put the laptop away and started entertaining the kid. We had breakfast and played during the morning. At lunch time, we ate lunch while watching a Star Wars movie. Then we headed to the Boston Children's Museum. We stayed until closing time, then headed to Rowan's favorite restaurant, Acapulcos, for dinner. Then we had more play time, and had "movie night," which was another Star Wars movie. Finally, the kid hit the sack at 10:30 PM and I jumped back on the laptop to do a bit of work.

Needless to say, it's been a super long, and exhausting, day for both of us.
