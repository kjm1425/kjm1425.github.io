## Day 5: Park Fun:

Today was all about the terrain park.  The crew tried to lay down some sick tricks but each of us did get some air.  Joe got the crash of the day with his face plant jibbin' a table top.  A round of shots went out to the crew for various reason but it was all good.  And hopefully we will have some new snow soon.

One of the highlights of the day was seeing Tom on the slopes.  Rumors were floating around that he was never riding the sweet white stuff, but we finally saw him linking turns in Ego Bowl.
