I've been heads down all day working on SMTP Diagnostics.  I did more work on the print preview, added an icon legend, and started work on the help file.  The help file is probably 70% complete.  Hopefully I can get the Chief Content Editor for White Peak (a.k.a., my wife Melanie) to review the help file this weekend.<br /><br />I feel the app is ready for public release but I still have a number of "administrative" tasks to complete before I can release it.  For instance SMTP Diagnostics still does not have a home page, and I need to setup the web store so users can purchase a license.  I hope to have these things in place within the next couple of weeks.<br /><br />Shoot me an email if you are interested in reviewing the preview release.
