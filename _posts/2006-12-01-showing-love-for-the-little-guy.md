Jeff Atwood has declared December 1 as "<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000735.html">Support your favorite small software vendor day</a>".  He is asking people to register those useful programs created by independent software vendors that are used on a regular basis.  As a small software vendor trying to make a living off my own software, I find this show of love great.
