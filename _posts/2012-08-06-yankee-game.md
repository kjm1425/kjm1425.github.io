Rowan has gone to at least one Yankee game a year at Yankee Stadium since he was born in March 2008. The only year he missed was 2009 when the new stadium opened. And yes, he attended a game - though he slept through most of it - at the old Yankee Stadium.

This year we watched the Yankees win over the Seattle Mariners. Rowan enjoyed the game, but not as much as past years. He thought the game was too long, and he was ready to leave by the seventh inning. But like a real trooper, he stayed and let Melanie and I enjoy the rest of the day.

The only bad part of the day was the return trip home. Bad storms were moving in throughout New York City all the way up to Boston. This caused a number of flights from LGA to Boston to cancel. Lucky for us, Melanie met another passenger who was non-reving and had rented a car. She offer to let us hitch a ride up to Boston, and we of course accepted her offer. We got home later than planned, but thanks to Jane we got home.
