Hello there, and welcome to KylieModen.com. I will be using this site to document ideas I have along the way. As a program manager, I get ideas all the time. From day dreaming about owning my own spa to inventing a new way for sand timers to work when playing board games with friends, I find myself constantly thinking.

This website is a way for me to document these ideas and utilize these one-off explorations in a more meaningful way than just leaving them as disparate thoughts in my head. 

In the future the purpose of this site may change, but for now you can enjoy the random ideas as I have time to document them.
