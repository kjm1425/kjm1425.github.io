Just came across this dandy project called <a href="http://rail.dei.uc.pt/">RAIL</a> - Runtime Assembly Instrumentation Library.  RAIL provides "an API that allows CLR assemblies to be manipulated and instrumented before they are loaded or executed."  Imagine if you will loading an assembly, inspecting it, altering the IL, and executing the mutated assembly or even saving it.  This has some interesting applications for aspect-oriented programming.
