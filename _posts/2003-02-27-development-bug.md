Lately I have started feeling the byte of the development bug.  It's been a while since I wrote any real code and the update to this site has got me wanting to do more.  So to help get started and to fix the work into my job, I decided to write some true interop examples between J2EE and .NET.  Today was all about installing the environment.
<br />
<br />I created a new Windows 2000 Advance Server VM under <a href="http://www.vmware.com/">VMWare</a>, installed <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/">J2SE</a>, <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a>, <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">TomCat</a>, <a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis/">Axis</a>, <a href="http://xml.apache.org/dist/xerces-j/">Xerces</a>, and IBM's <a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/webservicestoolkit">Web Services ToolKit</a> (WSTK).  The combination took longer than installing <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/">Visual Studio.NET</a>.  Still, I was happy with the amount of online documentation and the ease of use of the various installation programs.  I now have a clean environment ready for me to destroy.  Only regret was that I did not use Windows .NET Server 2003.  Including UDDI Services in my demo code would have been great.
