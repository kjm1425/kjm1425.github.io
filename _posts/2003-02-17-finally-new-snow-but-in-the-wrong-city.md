After two weeks of no new snow in Whistler, I return home just in time for a big dump in New York City.  Looks like over a foot of snow so far and it's still coming down.  I love it but I wish this had happened in Whistler.  And I wish I had a car because I would definitely be heading up to Catkills to snowboard.
