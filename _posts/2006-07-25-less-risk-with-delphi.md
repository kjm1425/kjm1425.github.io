A good read about one person's opinion on why <a href="http://blogs.borland.com/nickhodges/archive/2006/07/25/26224.aspx">Delphi is less risky</a> compared to Microsoft development tools.  I concur with this opinion.  Heck just the other day I incorporated some Delphi code that I wrote some 10 years ago into a customer application.
