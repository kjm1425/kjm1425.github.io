And for those wondering, mobile phone service seems to be out but the land lines are working.  I am in the process of looking for a non-electrical phone (i.e., non-coreless) so people can call the apartment and so we can call out.  As of right now, the Internet is the only way to reach Melanie or I.  Well, as long as we have battery power in the laptops.
