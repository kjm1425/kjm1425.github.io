A common question I get since moving to Salem is "Do you miss New York?"  I was thinking about that question this morning as I was standing on the 4-5-6 platform at Grand Central Station.  For those who don't know, that's in New York, and the answer is "No".  I haven't spent enough time in Salem or enough time away from New York to miss it yet.  It will probably hit me some time this summer but for now I haven't missed the Big Apple.  Heck, Melanie is still based out of JFK and sees the city more than I do.  I wonder if she misses it yet.
