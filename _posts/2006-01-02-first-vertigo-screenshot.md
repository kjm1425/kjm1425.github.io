Okay, I probably shouldn't post this screenshot because it is ugly and far from the final Vertigo UI.  But what the heck.  I have been talking about Vertigo for a year now and this screenshot shows the world I'm actually working on it (finally).<br /><br /><a href="http://www.thecave.com/images/blogimages/vertigo-20060102-snapshot.gif"><img src="http://www.thecave.com/images/blogimages/vertigo-20060102-snapshot.gif" width="80%" height="80%" border="0" alt="Early screenshot of Vertigo" /></a><br />Click the image to view full size.<br /><br />For those wondering, <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/vertigo.aspx">Vertigo is a desktop email client</a> that is being developed by White Peak Software and will be released later this year.  Feel free to post your comments, suggestions, and questions to <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/forums/Forum11-1.aspx">the Vertigo forum area</a>.
