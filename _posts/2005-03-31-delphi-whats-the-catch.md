There's a nice <a href="http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?joel.3.101416.64">thread</a> on Joel on Software discussing Delphi, reasons why it hasn't really caught on yet, and why it is a great development language.  It's a long thread but interesting.
<br />
<br />On a related note, Steve Trefethen of Borland has posted some resources on <a href="http://blogs.borland.com/stevet/archive/2005/03/15/3145.aspx">converting from VB to Delphi</a>.
