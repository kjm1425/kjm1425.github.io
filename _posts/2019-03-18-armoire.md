Fashion has always been something I find interesting, but I have never felt included in. Shows like "Project Runway", and even "America's Next Top Model" showcased amazing looks that I loved but never have been in the environment to wear. I even dabbled in creating my own clothes in college, taking a "Costume Technology" course where we really just learned basic sewing skills. Still though - I find myself continuing to doodle dress designs in my notebooks and loving couture looks I don't own myself. 

When Armoire founder [Ambika Singh](https://www.geekwire.com/2018/fashion-rental-startup-armoire-closet-future-raises-3m-grow-expand-offerings/) visited Microsoft campus earlier this month, I saw a new way for me to try out these more adventurous styles. While StitchFix, Rent the Runway and other clothing rental services exist, I loved Armoires pitch that allows you to take more risk as the unlimited closet you get access to allows you to take a chance on a piece you may not have tried before. Since you can return a piece at any time, the opportunity cost is reduced so much for people (like myself) who find themselves wanting to embrace more fashion forward pieces but struggle to balance that in environments where business casual is t-shirts and jeans. 

Armoire also has an interesting design element that claims to build a closet catered towards your taste that will evolve over time. If their algorithms can truly deliver, this is a great design for busy women who do not want to spend as much time searching for the perfect pieces. My current frustration is that there are just an overwhelming amount of options for women's clothes and shopping can almost feel like a burden. I hope to see more services popping up that take away this decision burden. While I could spend more time learning about sustainable brands, what's "in" this season, etc. ultimately, outsourcing this to algorithms and fashion curators makes a lot of sense. I really see Armoire being a way for me to embrace the fashion I love moving forward and am excited to try the service out.
