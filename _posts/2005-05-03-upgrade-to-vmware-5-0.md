title: 'Upgrade to VMWare 5.0'
category: uncategorized

For over a year I have been running my primary development environment in a guest OS using VMWare Workstation 4.x.  I run in full screen mode and I don't even notice that I am running under a guest OS.<br /><br />Tonight I installed the new VMWare Workstation 5.0.  I haven't run it through the ringer yet but I like what I see so far.  Guest OS seem to run faster and network communication is definitely much faster.  The old virtual NIC was only a 10mbps.  The new one is 1gbps, which is noticeably faster.  Although I haven't played with it, I'm excited about the multiple snapshots feature.  There's also a new clone feature that I need to read up on.  In my opinion existing 4.x users will want to upgrade to 5.0.
