## Day 9, 10, 11 and 12: Catch Up:

Things have really been hopin' in the Village and I haven't taken the time to update the web site.  So here is a brief recap from the last few days.

First, there are no pictures for Day 10.  Sorry but some bozo (named KT) forgot to bring the CF card.  Pictures for Day 9, 11 and 12 are finally online.

Kirby and Joe took a snowboard lesson on Monday, which consisted of pipe, park, and speed.  Yep, but have finally been introduced to the fun of park and half pipe.  Dave would be so proud.

Jeff had a fun experience on the slopes.  He lost a ski in Whistler Bowl and had to hike to retrieve it.  It would have been very funny to see but he was out on the slopes by himself that day.

Brooke and Josh has an incredible first day on Whistler.  Josh had a grin ear to ear all day.  We covered a lot of terrain and all of us at exhausted.

And finally, the Murphy's have arrived.  Shawn is already trying to start the drinking games.  Imagine that.

Until next time...
