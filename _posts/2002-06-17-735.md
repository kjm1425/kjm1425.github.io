Sometimes I think I live on <a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?location=UlKD%2bbogggnqkpsV56BqoReRhTJITSlIvbX0orB4g8akPxcB%2buZNsmiLDgmMHSCoVlmcZ1j6bPic2gYowLjv8%2bUA7TH%2fZAtthioX7sjSIH4%3d&amp;address=Jones%20St&amp;city=New%20York&amp;state=NY&amp;zipcode=10014&amp;country=US">one of the coolest streets</a> in Manhattan.  It is definitely one of the more unique Manhattan streets in that the street is only a block long and it is hidden away between Bleecker and West 4th, 6th and 7th Avenues.  But one of the things that make it a cool street is all the recent filming activity.
<br />
<br />Again this morning there was a film crew on-site a couple of doors over from my apartment preparing for a morning of shooting.  Last week a film instructor brought a group of students to Jones Street to talk about on-site filming.  And over the last few months there have been other film crews taking over the street.
<br />
<br />So even with all the recent drug activity at one end of my street, I still sometimes think I live on one of the coolest streets in Manhattan.
