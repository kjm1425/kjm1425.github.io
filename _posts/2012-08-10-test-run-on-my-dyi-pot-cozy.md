The other day I mentioned I made a <a href="http://thecave.com/2012/07/30/dyi-pot-cozy/">pot cozy for my cooking mug</a>. Today I decided to test it by cooking up a box of Kraft Macaroni &amp; Cheese. I'm happy to report the test was a success. 

I brought 2 cups of water to a slight boil, poured the hot water into the ziplock freezer bag containing the macaroni, and then I closed the bag. I placed the bag into the cooking mug, and I placed the mug into the cozy. I put on the cozy top, and about 15 minutes later the macaroni was ready (though I may only wait 10 minutes next time). I mixed the cheese, and was ready to eat. 

There was one unexpected surprise with using the pot cozy. I ate the Mac and Cheese directly from the bag, which was in the mug that was in the cozy. I was able to eat the very hot Mac and Cheese without having to hold a hot bag. The cozy kept the Mac and Cheese hot while I comfortably held the meal without fear of burning my hands.

I'm now looking forward to using the pot cozy on the trail in a couple of weeks where I plan to try cooking other hot meals.

Pictures from my test are available <a href="http://photos.thecave.com/Random/DYI-Pot-Cozy/24476733_NV9jrG">here</a>.
