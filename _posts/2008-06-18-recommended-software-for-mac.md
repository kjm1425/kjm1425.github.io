A good friend of mine, who just bought an iMac, asked what Mac software I use regularly and recommend. Instead of emailing a reply to him, I decided to post my list of recommended software here for all to see.<br /><br /><ul><br /><li><a href="http://vmware.com/products/fusion/">VMware Fusion</a> - Although I spend less time in Windows these days, I still have to use it for various development projects. So when I need to use Windows, I rely on VMware Fusion, which allows me to run an instance of Windows from within OS X.</li><br /><li>Mail.app - This is the email program that comes with OS X.  I use it to manage all my emails.</li><br /><li>iCal - This also comes with OS X and I use it daily.</li><br /><li><a href="http://www.spanningsync.com/">Spanning Sync</a> - I used this gem to synch my iCal calendars to Google calendars.  I currently synch 5 different calendars, a birthday calendar that I share with my wife, my personal calendar, my wife's calendar, a calendar for trips, and my work calendar.</li><br /><li><a href="http://www.nhoj.co.uk/youreinvited/">YAI (You Are Invited)</a> - This is a Mail.app plug-in that translates and transfers calendar invites from Outlook, Google, and others to iCal.</li><br /><li>Address Book - Another piece of software that comes with OS X.</li><br /><li><a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> - Damn fine text editor.</li><br /><li><a href="http://www.evernote.com/">Evernote</a> - For tracking various notes.</li><br /><li><a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">Open Office</a> - For word processing, spreadsheet, etc.  I'm using the beta for version 3.0, which support the Aqua interface and does not require X11.</li><br /><li><a href="http://www.adiumx.com/">Adium</a> - My IM client of choice. Adium supports different IM services including Messenger, Yahoo!, AIM, and Google Talk.</li><br /><li><a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/iphoto/">iPhoto</a> - From the iLife suite.
