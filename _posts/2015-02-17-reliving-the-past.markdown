I just spent the last two hours looking through past posts here at thecave. I was writing a lot for the four or five years, and some of those old posts are actually good. But more importantly reading through those old posts gave me a chance to relive my past. 

This makes me realize I need to post here more even if the post is short like this one. All too often I'll post something short to Twitter or Facebook, but I need to start posting it here too. It will be great to re-read my old posts five years from now.
