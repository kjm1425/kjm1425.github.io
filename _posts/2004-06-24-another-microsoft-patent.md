I thought Microsoft's <a href="?xml/2004_06_01_archive.xml#108695677194415311">patent</a> on //TODO was silly but Microsoft's <a href="http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1104-5244766.html">patent</a> for using human skin as a power conduit tops it.  Actually this patent sounds interesting.  I can see how wearable devices can benefit from a personal area network.
