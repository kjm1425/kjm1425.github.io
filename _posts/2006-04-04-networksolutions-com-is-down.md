I'm having problems resolving a couple of domain names and track the problem back to DNS.  I use Networksolutions's DNS for the domain names in question and to my surprise <a href="http://isc.sans.org/diary.php?storyid=1238">Networksolutions.com is down</a>.  Joy, joy.<br /><br />Update: Networksolutions is back!  Looks like the outage only lasted an hour or so.  I still don't know what happened through.<br /><br />Final update: Here's the alert message posted on Network Solutions web site:<br /><br /><div class="quote">"April 4th, 2006 11:00am EDT - This morning our collocation provider suffered a global outage from 7:56 a.m. to 10:02 a.m. (eastern) that impacted our systems.  The provider's outage affected access to Network Solutions products and services.  The provider has resolved their systems and access to our services has been resorted.  We appreciate your patience and apologize for the inconvenience. You may experience latency today as we continue to restore our services to full capacity."</div>
