Last year I kept a [travel log](http://www.thecave.com/2008/02/26/my-2008-trips) to see how much I really travel in 1 year.  It was interesting to see that I do too much travel and explains why it seems like I'm always on the go.  While I do not plan to travel nearly as much this year - actually my wife and I recently realized nearly 6 months will past between airplane travel for us, something that has not happened for me since 1997.  I'm usually on an airplane at least once a month.

So 2008 will not be as travel heavy as previous years but I still want to track my trips for the year.  So here is where I have been so far in 2008:

1. January 16: New York City (business)
2. January 29 - January 30: Killington VT
3. February 14 - February 17: Killington VT
4. February 24 - February 25: Portland ME
5. May 23 - May 25: East Durham NY (Irish Festival)
6. June 2 - June 10: Southern France (Aix en Provence and Nice)
7. June 20 - June 23: Camp Turner (Village Creek State Park, Arkansas)
8. June 27 - June 29: Loudon NH (NASCAR weekend)
9. July 5 - July 12: Lake Champlain VT
10. July 25 - July 28: Memphis TN
11. August 3: New York City (Yankees Game - they won!)
12. September 5 - September 7: Lake George, NY (Camp Murphy)
13. September 24 - September 29: Bryn Athyns, PA (Laura and Jason's wedding)
