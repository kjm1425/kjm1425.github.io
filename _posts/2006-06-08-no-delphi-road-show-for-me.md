I planned to attend the <a href="http://208.109.7.163/html/borland_inside/landing.htm">Delphi Road Show</a> today hosted in NYC, but it seems other forces had other plans for me.  I'm bummed not to be in attendance.  For one, I want to show my support for Delphi and the new DevCo.  I also wanted to hear <a href="http://blogs.borland.com/davidi/">David I</a> talk about the future.  And lastly, I was hoping to network with other Delphi developers.  But it didn't happen for me.  I can only now hope that they add another NYC date, or better yet a Boston date.  Or even provide a webcast of the road show once the tour as ended.<br /><br />Update: <a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive/2006/06/08/delphi_road_show_webcast.aspx">A web cast date has been added.</a>
