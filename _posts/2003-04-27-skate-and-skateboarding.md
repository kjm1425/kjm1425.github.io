This weekend was the return to the skateboard for me.  I have not been on a skateboard, aside from my freebord which is a different type of skateboard all together, in more than 20 years.  But I finally broke down, bought a new board, and hit the Hudson River Park.  And to add to the excitement, Melanie decided to buy a pair of in-line skates.  So now we can ride together down the Hudson.
<br />
<br />One other thing.  I want to be a bit better at skateboarding.  I've only gone out twice now and both times were for only an hour or so.  But darn it, I want to be better.  Tricks seems so easy in my dreams.  It should be that easy in real life.
<br />
<br />If you want to see some folks who do make it look easy in real life, check out the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000694WN/qid=1051500365/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/104-6853332-9041536?v=glance&amp;s=dvd&amp;n=507846">Dogtown and Z-Boys</a> video.  These guys know how to ride.  The <a href="http://www.z-boys.com/">moves</a> they do are just sick.  I can't imagine carving the concrete as low to the ground as these guys get.
