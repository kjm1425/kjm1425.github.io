I had the pleasure of meeting <a href="http://www.wintellect.com/about/instructors/instructorbios.aspx?id=3">Jeffrey Richter</a> of Wintellect today during his full day talk on .NET Framework internals.  He talked on topics such as threading, asynchronous programming model, app domain, reflection, and key differences between C# and VB.NET.  His presentation style was entertaining, and I was amazed at his depth of knowledge around the .NET Framework.  I definitely learned more than a thing or two from Jeffrey.
<br />
<br />I ended my day with the monthly <a href="http://www.iccanyc.org/">ICCA</a> meeting featuring <a href="http://www.consultadhoc.com/">Liz Lynch</a> as tonight's speaker.  Liz is a business management consultant and the author of <a href="http://www.consultadhoc.com/booklet.html">102 Secrets to Smarter Networking</a>.  She presented her approach for smarter networking, which is based on concepts of preparing, connecting, and strengthening.  Her advice was invaluable and will help me improve my networking skills.
<br />
<br />It's been a great day of learning.  However, I'm exhausted and ready for bed.
