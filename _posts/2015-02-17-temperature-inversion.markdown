Seeing "temperature inversion" in the Stowe snow report this morning is music to my ears. It's -20°F in town but a balmy 2°F at the summit. Time to ride. 

Speaking of odd temperatures...Whistler Village is 50°F warmer than the Village of Stowe this morning. I'm starting to think our Whistler winter vacation next week will feel more like a spring break vacation.
