Met up with Melanie in DC for the Murphy's holiday party.  Good times and good friends.  My friend Tom from Memphis joined us for the party, and long time friends from St. Louis now DC area residents Linda and Jeff stopped by for a while.  Always great seeing them.
<br />
<br />The traveling thing has Melanie and I really busy lately.  A typical 7 to 10 days will have both of us in up to 5 different cities.  For example, my schedule has me back in Jacksonville, FL on Monday, Killington, Vermont for the weekend, followed by Memphis, then NYC, and finally Sunday River, Maine.  Melanie will be home in PA, back to Killington, NYC, Paris, and Sunday River as well but I am not sure of the order of her schedule.  And next month is shaping up to be more of the same but with different destination cities.

<br />So see ya at the airport terminals...
