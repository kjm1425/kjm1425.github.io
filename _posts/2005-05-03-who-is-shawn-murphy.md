After being off of IM for the last few weeks, I finally got around to re-installing <a href="http://www.trillian.cc/">Trillian</a>.  (I still had not installed it after my last hard drive crash.)  I was happy to see a new version since I had been running my registered copy of Trillian Pro 2.x for the last few years.<br /><br />The new version includes a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a> feature.  It will display the Wikipedia description when you mouse over certain works and phrases.  But it's not perfect.<br /><br />I mentioned a buddy of name Shawn Murphy.  To my surprise there was a Wikipedia desription for have name.  "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Murphy">Shawn Murphy</a> (born July 27, 1951 in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island) is a Canadian politician. Murphy is a current member of the Liberal Party of Canada in the Canadian House of Commons,..."  I'm not sure way but I found this to be funny.  <br /><br />The Wikipedia feature is a neat idea, but I'm not sure how useful it will be for me.
