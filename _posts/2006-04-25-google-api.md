I've been working away the last few weeks on a new web service SOA testing tool.  However, today I decided to take a break and see what else is happening in the world.  One of the things I played with today is Google Calendar.  It's pretty cool and I think I will try it out for the next few weeks.  <br /><br />Google Calendar got me thinking about synchronizing my calendar, which is currently stored in Outlook, with Google Calendar.  This lead me to the <a href="http://code.google.com/">Google API</a> at http://code.google.com/.  The API uses REST principals with Atom and RSS feeds.  Now I have even more fun things to play with.
