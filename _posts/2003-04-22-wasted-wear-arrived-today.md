My latest order of WASTED Wear arrived today.  The [WASTED hoodie](http://www.cafeshops.com/wastedboarding.5440274) rocks!  It's comfy and the print job is nice.  Not as nice as the t-shirt given away in Whistler but still nice.  The golf shirt is okay but the logo is a little low for my liking.  And the shirt quality is only so so.  The [baby doll shirt](http://www.cafeshops.com/wastedboarding.5439853) looks good though.  Can't wait for Melanie to try it on.

You too can own WASTED Wear by shopping at the [WASTED online store](http://www.cafeshops.com/wastedboarding).  How's that for marketing?
