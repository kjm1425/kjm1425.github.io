Last week I posted <a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive/2006/01/16/why_no_free_personal_edition_of_borland_developer_studio.aspx">a few remarks on the lack of a free Personal or Trial Edition of Borland Developer Studio</a>.  A friend of mine wanted to give Delphi a try but unfortunately he cannot because Borland does not provide a way for him to do this.<br /><br />As it turns out on the same day Marco Cantu made a newsgroup and blog posting on the exact same topic.  And there were a number of replies from both sides regarding the issue, which I have included below.<br /><br />Still I think it is a mistake for Borland to not have a Personal or Trial version available for download available today.<br /><br /><a href="http://blog.marcocantu.com/blog/perstrial_again.html">More of the topic from Marco Cantu</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://blogs.borland.com/abauer/archive/2006/01/18/22786.aspx">And a differ point of view.</a>
