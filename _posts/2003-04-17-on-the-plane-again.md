So here I am flying back to New York.  I spoke at a Web services boot camp today in the Research Triangle of North Carolina.  A fun day, I must say.  But it got me thinking, and the first thought was that I don't post enough technical content on this site.  Why is that?
<br />
<br />The main reason is most likely are result of a lack of excitement in technology with my job.  As a consultant, you sometimes have to work with less interesting technologies because of customer demand.  Lately that less interesting technology for me has been Microsoft SharePoint technologies.
<br />
<br />Now don't get me wrong.  SharePoint version 2.0 is a nice offering, and I have been impressed with the ASP.NET implementation.  It is once again proof that some of the best and brightest minds work at Microsoft.  Unfortunately for me, to be involved with technology at a level that would interest me the most would mean relocating to the Seattle area.
<br />
<br />Relocating is not going to happen though, especially right now.  First and foremost, I love New York City.  And I love being close to the New England area, especially Vermont.
<br />
<br />So what is a technology starved individual like myself who gets terribly excited about technology of interest, like Web services and the Microsoft .NET Framework, to do?  Let me know if you can help me out.  I'm soul searching my career and I need guidance.
<br />
<br />And on a totally unrelated note, when can I start surfing the Net from the plane in a very cost effective way?  Wireless net access everywhere.  That's the way life should be be.
