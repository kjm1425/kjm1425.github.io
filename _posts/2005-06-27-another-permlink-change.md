title: 'Another PermLink Change'
category: uncategorized

I had to make another change to the blog item permlinks for this site.  I realized a URL like http://www.thecave.com/2005/06/23/office_pranks.aspx would cause problems in the future.  I needed a way to identify the purpose of the permlink so I added archive/ before the year.  The new permlink structure look like this:<br /><br />http://www.thecave.com/archive/yyyy/mm/dd/blog_item_title.aspx<br /><br />yyyy is the four digit year, mm is the two digit month, and dd is the two digit day.  Including "archive" to the URL structure will give me more flexibility to use yyyy/mm/dd/ is other virtual URLs.<br /><br />On a related note, I completed the monthly archive URL mapping.  The structure is as follows:<br /><br />http://www.thecave.com/archive/yyyy/mm.aspx<br /><br />This makes it easy to enter the URL for any month on the blog.  For example, <a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive/2005/06.aspx">http://www.thecave.com/archive/2005/06.aspx</a>.
