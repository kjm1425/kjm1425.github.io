title: 'Never Ending To-Dos'
category: uncategorized
---

It seems like the work never ends when it comes to publishing a new software product.  At the end of each day I feel like I am one step closer to having SMTP Diagnostics ready for general release.  But by the next morning I feel like there is an endless list of to-dos remaining that must be completed before program is ready for release.<br /><br />For those wondering SMTP Diagnostics is a program that will <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/smtpdiagnostics.aspx">help you troubleshoot problems with outgoing emails or configuring SMTP servers</a>.<br /><br />That sentence is an example of the never ending to-dos.  I need a consistent message regarding the program's purpose for marketing, and I like the sentence I just typed.  Now it is a matter of copying the same message "helps you troubleshoot problems with outgoing emails or configuring SMTP servers" to the program help file, the SMTP Diagnostics web page, to the home page for White Peak Software, and so on.  See...never ending to-dos.
