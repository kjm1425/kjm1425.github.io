Today is our last full day in New York.  The movers arrive tomorrow at 8 AM.  We have almost everything packed.  We ran out of boxes last night so we couldn't finish.  <br /><br />I'm not sure how soon we will have Internet access from the new home.  That's one of my projects today...to schedule cable TV and Internet hook up.  So don't expect a quick reply to emails and forum postings for the next few days.<br /><br />So how will we spend our final day in New York?  We have a few more things to pack, and the DVR/cable boxes need to be returned to Time Warner.  I'm meeting a good friend this afternoon for a quick happy hour drink followed by date night with my wife.  We are going to dinner at the place of our first date.  Unfortunately it won't be a late night because the movers are coming early tomorrow but I'm sure it will still be a special time for us.<br /><br />I thought leaving New York was going to be hard, but as it turns out I'm ready to go.  The fact we spent our last weekend up in Vermont is probably a sign that we need to move.  We just don't enjoy the city the way we use too, and there are so many other things we want out of life that are hard to obtain from here unless you have lots of money.  So it's farewell to New York, hello Salem.
