title: 'Free Wireless Internet Access'

Melanie and I moved to a new apartment this week and as a result we have temporarily lost our Internet connection.  No DSL and the phone has not been installed so dial out is not possible.  For fun I decided to see if there was an available wireless network somewhere in our new building.  To my surprise there is!  And now Melanie and I have free Internet access until I get the DSL connection installed.  Wireless LANs are the best!
