title: 'I Admit to Being Lazy and Dumb'
category: uncategorized
---

I've always said I'm lazy programmer, which makes me a good programmer.  For instance, I'm too lazy to perform the same task over and over on a computer so I write a tool.  And I hate writing the same code over and over.  I would rather write it once, package it up in a library, and forget the details.  All I want to remember is the API.<br /><br />I also believe my lack of a quality education helps me think of solutions that smarter individual may never even consider.  My seemingly childish approach to problem solving helps me think of solutions to the most time consuming yet simple problems.<br /><br />But Philipp Lenssen at Google Blogoscoped has really summed up <a href="http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2005-08-24-n14.html">why good programmers are lazy and dumb</a>.  Give it a read.
