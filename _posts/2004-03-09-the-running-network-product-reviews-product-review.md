Congratulations to Josh for the recent award on one of his New Balance shoe designs.

<br /><a href="http://www.runningnetwork.com/productreviews/springshoereview04awards.html">The Running Network -- Product Reviews</a>: "New Balance has focused its attention on the trails for several seasons now; in fact, some of its greatest successes in recent years have come in this category. This spring's introduction of the new 1100 marks their best effort to date."
