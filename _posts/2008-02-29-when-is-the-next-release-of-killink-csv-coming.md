I have received a number of requests for new features in <a href="http://www.killink.com/">Killink CSV</a> to be included in the next release of Killink CSV.  I have been telling people I hope to have the next release available download no later than the end of February.  Well, today is the end of February and the new release isn't quite ready.  More testing is needed before this next release is made available to the public.  Assuming all goes well, the new release should be available within the week.<br /><br />The 3 most requested features coming in the next release are:<ul><br /><li>Sorting</li><br /><li>Unicode support</li><br /><li>Bulk paste</li><br /></ul>Bulk paste, for those who might be wondering what it it, enables you to paste a value or a set of values from the Windows Clipboard into a selection of cells.  This is a neat feature because it enables the user to quickly set the value for a large number of cells.<br /><br />So if you are one of the people waiting on the next release of <a href="http://www.killink.com/">Killink CSV</a> then keep an eye on <a href="http://www.thecave.com/">this blog</a> and or the announcement area of the <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/forums/">White Peak Software support forums</a>.
