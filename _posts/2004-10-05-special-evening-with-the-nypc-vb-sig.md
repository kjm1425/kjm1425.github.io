Nik Kalyani of the DotNetNuke core team will be speaking at the next NYPC VB SIG on Wednesday, October 6.  I've heard Nik will be talking about the internals of the portal software and how to write your own extensions.  You should plan to attend if you have an interest in DotNetNuke.  I know I will be there.  The event starts at 6:15 PM at the Microsoft Office, 1290 6th Avenue, one block north of Radio City Music Hall.
