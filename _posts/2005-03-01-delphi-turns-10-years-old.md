Okay, so this posting is a little dated but Delphi turned 10 years old on February 14 of this year.  Delphi has long been a favorite development language of mine, and I have always been bummed about not getting opportunities to use it more.  But that will change very soon as White Peak Software has plans to develop a new desktop application using Delphi.  I will speak more on that in the coming weeks and months.  <br /><br />Meanwhile, check out this Borland Radio <a href="http://bdn.borland.com/article/0,1410,32973,00.html">broadcast replay</a> of a phone interview with Anders Hjelsberg, Gary Whizin, and Zack Urlocker.  They talk about the days leading up to the release of Delphi version 1.0 on February 14, 1995.
