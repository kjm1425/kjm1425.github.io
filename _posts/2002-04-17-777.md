Just when you thought swing technology could not be any better, some guy is issued a <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/srchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1='6,368,227'.WKU.&amp;OS=PN/6,368,227&amp;RS=PN/6,368,227">patent on side to side swinging</a>.  Yes, swinging!  The activity most of us enjoyed as a kid.  Hopefully the guy will not expect retroactive royalty payments.

<br />Speaking of patents, I have invented a new way to scratch an itch.  When I haven't shaved in a day or so, I will scratch my arm with my chin.  I hope to have the patent papers submitted later today.
