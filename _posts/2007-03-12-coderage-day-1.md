[CodeRage](http://conferences.codegear.com/coderage07) Day 1 is over and overall I thought it was a great day.  Unfortunately Day 1 got off to a rough start.  Bandwidth issues caused video and audio outages throughout the morning but the problems were, for the most part, resolved later into the day.

The session that excited me the most was the [New VCL for Delphi 2007](http://video.codegear.com/coderage/ragingconference.exe/convert?track=&amp;page=allsessions.html#REFNO1270).  The new features centered around Vista look great and the timing couldn't be more perfect since [White Peak Software](http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/) has plans to start supporting Vista in new applications very soon.

For those of you who missed today's session, no worries.  [CodeGear](http://www.codegear.com/) has plans to post the recorded sessions.  A few sessions are already posted [here](http://torrent.codegear.com/coderage/) including the New VCL for Delphi 2007 session.
