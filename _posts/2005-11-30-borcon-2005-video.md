Borland has posted a video from the 2005 Borland Developer Conference that includes a <a href="http://bdn.borland.com/article/0,1410,33406,00.html">demonstration of the new Borland Developer Studio 2006</a>.  I don't know about you, but I am anxiously awaiting the release of Delphi 2006 and the new Dev Studio.  I'm really excited about the new features included in the upcoming release.
