I am pleased to announce the launch of the Hour Children <a href="http://www.hourchildren.org/">web site</a>.  The site was funded through a service grant provided by the <a href="http://www.taprootfoundation.org/">Taproot Foundation</a> of which I am a volunteer.
<br />
<br />Hour Children is a non-profit family service provider providing short- and long-term support to incarcerated mothers, ex-offenders and their children.  It has been an awarding experience to use my skills for an organization that provides such loving care to mothers in need, to their children, and to the community.
