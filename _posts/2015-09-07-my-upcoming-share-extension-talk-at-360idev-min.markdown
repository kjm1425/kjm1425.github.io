I'm excited to be one of the speakers at the upcoming [360idev-min][1] conference in Greenville, SC. In my talk I'll share the things you need to know about when writing a share extension for your iOS app. 

If you plan to attend [360idev-min][1], then use the coupon code **SpeakerFriend** to save $100 when purchasing your ticket. 

And let me know if you are attending so we can meet up in person.
