It's been over a month since my last blog posting.  I've been very busy the last 2 months and haven't had time to make any thoughtful postings.  Today's no different.<br /><br />For those who don't know me well I travel a lot.  Not as much as I did a few years ago but enough.  I have definitely scaled back on the travel in recent years, but I'm still out of town at least twice a month on average.  So I thought I might be fun to track the places I visit in 2007.

I'll update this page after each trip.  That way I will know if I travel as much as I think a do.
