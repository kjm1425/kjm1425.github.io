12:27 am Sunday morning waiting for the number 6 downtown.  The uptown 4 speeds by on the express line and I realize I am living a surreal moment in New York.  The greatest city in the world, Saturday night, and my evening includes tea and a poetry reading on Bowery, Xbox and Budweiser,  caso dip and conversations about how hard it is dating in New York.  This is my night.  Uptown number 6 stops and people get off.  Couples holding hands.  Guys with their umbrellas.  It must still be raining outside.
<br />
<br />Finally the downtown number 6 arrives.  I board the train and find a seat.  She's cute but not my Melanie.  A legless man is making his way down the car on his fist with a coffee can of coins.  Hand outs please.  I wonder how he got down into the subway, and I wonder how he will leave.
<br />
<br />My stop...Lafayette and Bleecker St.  It's raining.  Crack!  Thunder and lightening in February...how weird.  Great the rain is coming down harder.  Just my luck.  "There goes my hair," says a bridge and tunnel ho.  Many more looking for shelter from the rain.  What losers!  Just walk in it; you won't melt.  And if you do, who cares.
<br />
<br />A surreal night in New York City.  The words sounded better in my head 30 minutes ago.  Unfortunately for you, this is what you get.
