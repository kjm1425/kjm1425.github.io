After a few days off working on a top secret project, I am back to post another weblog.  Okay, so the project is not top secret, and I didn't really have a few days off.  I was working for my employer <a href="http://www.avanade.com/">Avanade</a>.  I'm really just looking for another excuse to test <a href="http://pro.blogger.com/">blogger</a> new e-mail feature.
