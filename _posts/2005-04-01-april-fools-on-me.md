My mom and sister got me good today with an April Fools joke.  I had forgotten that it was April Fools Day and totally fell for the joke.<br /><br />My sister is pregnant and is expected to deliver within the next couple of weeks.  I received an e-mail from my mom with the subject line "We're on our Way!!!"  The e-mail said, "Renay's going to the hospital.  I think this might be it!!!!!"<br /><br />Believing this to be true, Melanie and I jumped into action.  I was on the phone calling Mom and Renay to confirm.  Melanie was checking flights to Memphis.  And we were already thinking about what we needed to pack.  2 minutes later after reaching Renay on her mobile, I heard the infamous phrase "April Fools!"
