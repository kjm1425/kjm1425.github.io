Melanie and I were cursed of sorts by mother nature last year when it came to attending outdoor sporting events together.  Baseball games we went to were either cold, rainy, or both.  And it rained on us at the U.S. Open for a second year in a row.  The last time we remember attending a pro sporting event outdoors without bad weather had to be in 2002.  But last night our bad luck finally changed.<br /><br />We had a great time at Yankee Stadium watching New York triumph over Oakland.  And the weather was perfect.  No rain and the temperature was ideal.  Hopefully the rest of the summer will be like this for us. <br /><br /><br />
