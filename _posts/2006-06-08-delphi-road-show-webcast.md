Did David I read my <a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive/2006/06/08/no_delphi_road_show_for_me.aspx">posting</a> hoping for a webcast of the Delphi Road Show?  I doubt it but at least great minds think alike.  A <a href="http://208.109.7.163/html/borland_inside/weblanding.htm">webcast date for the Delphi tour</a> has been added.  Thanks DevCo!
