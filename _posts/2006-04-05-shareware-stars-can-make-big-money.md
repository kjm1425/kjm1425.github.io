Ever wonder how much money WinZip brings in per year, or how much money Jasc, makers of Paint Shop Pro, makes annually?  Corel now owns these two and Corel is planning to go public, which means disclosure to this information.  <br /><br />Thomas Warfield over at A Shareware Life has <a href="http://www.asharewarelife.com/2006/04/winzip_and_jasc.html">posted the numbers</a> and a link to the entire prospectus.  Give it a quick read and see that shareware stars do make big money.  At least these two do.
