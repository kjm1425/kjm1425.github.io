The brief <a href="http://www.ny1.com/ny/TopStories/SubTopic/index.html?topicintid=1&amp;subtopicintid=1&amp;contentintid=23113">power outage</a> in the lower Manhattan was an interesting experience.  With no power in the West Village, shops and restaurants were forced to close.  This sent a large number of people out onto the streets.  And traffic was a total mess with no traffic signals working.  Subways were not working and buses were overflowing with people.
<br />
<br />I was planning to meet Melanie and Brenna for lunch in Central Park just as the power went out.  So I started walking.  And I walked, and I walked.  I can now say I have walked from my apartment to Melanie's Upper Eastside pad with only one brief stop in Central Park.  Although an enjoyable walk, it's not something I care to do on a regular basis.
