title: 'Renaming SMTP Diagnostics?'
category: uncategorized
---

The White Peak SMTP Diagnostics program will be released to the general public next week, but before I release it I have been thinking about a name change.  While SMTP Diagnostics definitely tells what the program does, the name is a bit geeky.  This makes me wonder if I should use a different name.<br /><br />How about it folks?  Should I rename the program with a less geeky name?  And if so, what name might you suggest?  Or should I leave the name as is?
