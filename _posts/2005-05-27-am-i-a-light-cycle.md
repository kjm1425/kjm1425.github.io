title: 'Am I a Light Cycle'
category: uncategorized
---

I took the "What Video Game Charater am I?" quiz and it said I am a Light Cycle, which is cool since I really like the movie Tron.  However it also said that if I am not a Light Cycle then I'm an Asteroid.  This is also also cool to me.  I remember staying at my cousin's house once and playing a single game of asteriods for 18 hours straight.  We took shifts to keep the game going.<br /><br />So which am I, a Light Cycle or an Asteroid?<br /><br /><table border="0"><tr><td><br /><a href="http://quiz.ravenblack.net/videogame.pl"><img border="0" align="LEFT" width="150" height="80" src="http://quiz.ravenblack.net/videogame/16.png" alt="What Video Game Character Are You? I am a Light Cycle." /></a>I am <b>a Light Cycle</b>.<br /><br /><br />I drive fast, I turn fast, I do everything fast. I even breakfast. I tend to confuse people with my sudden changes of heart. Sometimes I even confuse myself, which tends to cause problems. <a href="http://quiz.ravenblack.net/videogame.pl">What Video Game Character Are You?</a><br /></td></tr></table><br /><br /><table border="0"><tr><td><br /><a href="http://quiz.ravenblack.net/videogame.pl"><img border="0" align="LEFT" width="150" height="80" src="http://quiz.ravenblack.net/videogame/2.png" alt="What Video Game Character Are You?

Usually I keep on doing whatever I'm doing, and it takes something special to make me change my mind. <a href="http://quiz.ravenblack.net/videogame.pl">What Video Game Character Are You?</a><br /></td></tr></table>
