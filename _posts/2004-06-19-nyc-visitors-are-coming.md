My friend Phil was in town this week which means one thing.  Time for [BenZona](http://www.benzonaband.com/) to rock [Luna Lounge](http://www.lunalounge.com/).  They had a great gig last night and it was good to see Phil, Keith and others again.  We also stuck around to hear San Francisco based [Candy From Strangers](http://www.candyfromstrangers.com/) who I definitely got into.

Speaking of NYC visitors, my mom, brother Andy, and his son (my nephew) Lucas will be arriving in New York within a few hours.  It will be Andy and Lucas's first time to the Big Apple.  We have the next few days planned out to wear them out.  From Central Park to Time Square to Coney Island to a Staten Island Yankees game, Melanie and I will definitely keep the family busy.

And the fun doesn't stop there.  My good friend John from Cleveland by way of St. Louis will be in town too.  Of course we will be meeting up for a drink or two.  A week of catching up with friends and family.  What could be better?
