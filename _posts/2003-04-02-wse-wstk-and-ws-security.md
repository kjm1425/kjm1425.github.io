I spent the morning taking a deeper look at WS Security using Microsoft's WSE and IBM WSTK.  Specifically I wanted to learn more about encrypting a SOAP message, and I have to say I am not only impressed with the standard but with the implementations from both Microsoft and IBM.  Once I resolved issues around my X.509 certificate, I was able to play.  I found it very easy to sign and encrypt my SOAP messages.  And on initial glance, it looks like interop between the two toolkits works well.
<br />
<br />If I have more time, I hope to play with WS Security more.  It's an interesting spec.  Unfortunately it looks like I am about to spend the next few weeks learning SharePoint v2.0, something I'm not all to happy about.  Not that it is a bad product.  It actually looks good, but I'm just not interested in it.
