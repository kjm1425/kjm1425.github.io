So Rowan and I decided to join her. Rowan has wanted to visit the Eiffel Tower for as long as I can remember, so that's what we did on this trip. We flew to Paris, went to the Eiffel Tower, then flew back home. Pictures from our short trip are available [here][gallery].

Rowan was a real trooper during this trip. He handled the long plane ride, time zone changes, and lack of sleep like a seasoned traveler.
