Melanie and I were planning to fly into Manchester, NH next week and drive to Vermont for a break from NYC.&nbsp; However confusion set in when we started checking the fly availability and car rentals.&nbsp; Flights into Manchester are filling up and car rentals are sold out.&nbsp; What gives?
<br />&nbsp;
<br />Duh!&nbsp; The Democratic Convention 2004 starts on Sunday, July 26 in Boston.&nbsp; No wonder Manchester is so busy that weekend.&nbsp; Needless to say, Melanie and I are breaking convention (no pun intended) and driving up from NYC to avoid the Boston/Manchester madness.
