Some might be wondering why I didn't post a blog entry announcement that I'm a father-to-be.  After all such big news rightfully deserves a posting.  Truth be told, I didn't want to share the news publicly until after the closing on the new house for fear that the mortgage company might find out and decide not to provide us the loan for the house.  I'm sure I was being a bit paranoid but given the current state of the leading market I did not want to chance it.<br /><br />I did, however, post a slight hint on July 23.  The posting title is "<a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive/2007/07/23/excited_about_expected_new_arrival.aspx">Excited About Expected New Arrive</a>" and while the posting talks about arrival of my new MacBook Pro, I was actually more excited about finding out I'm going to be a dad.  July 23 is the day I found out.
