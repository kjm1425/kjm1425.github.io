I finally got in some quality Xbox time last year thanks to Melanie.  The awesome Tony Hawk's Underground (THUG) was the game of choice.  That game is so addicting.  I couldn't stop playing.  I'm not far in the game but I have hit New Jersey, Manhattan, and Tampa.  I'm really starting to get the hang of the controls which means better tricks and higher scores.  But I need to continue playing it to maintain and improve my skills.  Taking two months off between sessions is no way to finish a game.  Maybe I can squeeze in another hour sometime tomorrow morning before work.<br /><br /><br />
