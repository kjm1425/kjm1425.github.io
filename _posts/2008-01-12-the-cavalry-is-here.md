My very good buddy Darren has come up from <strike>Tampa</strike>St. Pete to help with work on the new house for 3 days.  I can't begin to say how grateful I am having Darren here to help.  Work on the house is progressing nicely now and we're hoping to have most of the rooms completed by the end of the weekend.<br /><br />Thanks for the help Darren.  I owe you big time!
