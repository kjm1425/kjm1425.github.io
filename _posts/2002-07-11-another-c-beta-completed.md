I just finished the latest in Microsoft C# beta exams, 71-315 Develop and Implementing Web Applications with Microsoft Visual C#.NET and Microsoft Visual Studio.NET.  The test was easier than the <a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive/2002_06_01_archive.aspx#85194835">last one</a> but still had challenging questions.  Those planning to take this exam should have a working knowledge of Web app setup projects, security settings via the web.config, working with DataList, Repeater, and DataGrid server controls, how to write custom user controls, and once again ADO.NET, some XML, and how to consume Web services.
<br />
<br />And yes, for those wondering...I rescheduled the exam so I could take it this morning in Memphis.
