I know I have been slow to post tech talk on this blog lately.  The ironic thing is that I have been doing more .NET work over the last couple of months than I have done over the last year.  I even completed my MCSD for .NET last week.  Although I took all the .NET exams last year I needed to pass my one elective, which for me was the SQL Server exam.  I previously took the 4.2 and 7.0 SQL Server exams and I was worried about the 2000.  But it turned out to be the easiest of the three, the most developer focused, and I was able to pass by not studying, playing Xbox, and drinking beer the next better.  Go figure.

<br />Hopefully I will get back into posting on this blog soon.  My customer work is very exciting and gives me lots to talk about.  For example, we have extended WSDL to support our own binding, written tools for generating a proxy class to our own services, and are building out a framework by which developers do not need to write code for middle-tier component that most retrieve information from various backend resources.  Exciting stuff.
