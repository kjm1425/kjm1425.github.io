Melanie recently had cable TV setup in the apartment.  Yep, she is trying to bring me into the '90s.  Next thing you know, we'll have a microwave.  Anyway...I spent the day veggin' out on our new comfy couch watching cable TV and concluded that <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Saturday_Night_Live/index.html">Saturday Night Live</a> must be one of the most aired cable TV shows in America today.  It seems to be on all the time.  From the original <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/comics/gildaradner/snlcast.html">Not Ready for Prime Time Players</a> to those bad 80s and 90s seasons, you are only a few clicks of the remote away from another broadcast of SNL.  Now back to <a href="http://www.nick.com/all_nick/tv_supersites/spongebob/main.jhtml">Sponge Bob Square Pants</a>, Nickelodeon's top rated kid's cartoon show where 40% of the viewers are adults.
