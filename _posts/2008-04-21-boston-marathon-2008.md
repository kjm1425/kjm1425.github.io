I did something a bit different today.  My friend Dana invited me to tag along with him as he took pictures at the starting line of the Boston Marathon for Boston.com.  Despite having to get up at 4:30 AM this morning, it was a lot of fun.  I even got a [few shots](http://thecave.smugmug.com/gallery/4772984_3mrsK/1/283153640_nnZgX) in myself like this one of [Lance Armstrong](http://thecave.smugmug.com/gallery/4772984_3mrsK/1/283165438_TTCiT) just before the start of the race.
