Loyal readers of my weblog site, I wanted to let you know that I have setup a <a href="http://www.wastedboarding.com/wastedblog/home.aspx">new blog</a> for the upcoming WASTED II trip.  Once I get to Whistler...Melanie and I are leaving on Friday, January 31, I will be making regular posting about the trip.  I will make the same posting on this site but you will have to go to <a href="http://www.wastedboarding.com/">WASTEDBoarding.com</a> to see the online gallery of daily pictures.
<br />
<br />I can't wait for this trip.  It's going to be so much fun.  I wish everyone could join us.
