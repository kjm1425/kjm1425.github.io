The possible answer to my Xbox problems.  I found a How-To that explains step by step <a href="http://users.skynet.be/bk231905/tutorials/pdf/Xbox-Thompson-DVD-drive-laser-adjustment-procedure.pdf">how to adjust</a> the laser with a Thompson DVD drive, which is the drive I have in my XBox.  Interesting note, there are three different <a href="http://forums.xbox-scene.com/index.php?act=ST&amp;f=23&amp;t=17216&amp;s=3ede7a8f2ebae3291651ee4e2cd10a85">DVD drives</a> that can come with an Xbox, Phillips, Thompson, and Samsung.  From what I have read, Thompson is the worse drive to have and the Samsung drive is the best.  If tweaking the laser does not work then I will look at replacing the DVD drive itself.
