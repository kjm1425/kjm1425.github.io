[<img src="/images/blogimages/bcm.gif" border="0" alt=" Micro-ISV: From Vision to Reality " align="left" />](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590596013/whitepeaksoft-20?creative=327641&amp;camp=14573&amp;link_code=as1) [Bob Walsh](http://www.todoorelse.com/)'s book [Micro-ISV: From Vision to Reality](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590596013/whitepeaksoft-20?creative=327641&amp;camp=14573&amp;link_code=as1) is finally on sale at Amazon.  You can also [buy the eBook version](http://www.apress.com/book/bookDisplay.html?bID=10057) from directly from APress.

I've not read the book yet but I'm looking forward to it.  I ordered my copy and should have it in a couple of days.  I'll post a review once I read it, but I know it's going to be a great book for those looking to start a software company and for those of us still in the early years of running our own software company.  And if that doesn't convince you to buy the book then maybe the fact that my interview from Bob is on Page 263.
