A common question I get is "How is <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/">White Peak Software</a> doing?"  The answer is quiet simply "We're doing great."  Revenues continue to grow and we are inching closer to the release of our next product.  We've also done some exciting <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/">custom software</a> work over the last year.  <br /><br />I have decided to start posting news briefs on some of our more exciting, and successful, custom software work.  You can read the postings in the <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/forums/Forum4-1.aspx">White Peak Software Announcements forum</a> or by subscribing to the <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/forums/RssFeed4-0-0-1.aspx">announcement feed</a> using your <a href="http://www.feeddemon.com/">favorite RSS feed reader</a>.
