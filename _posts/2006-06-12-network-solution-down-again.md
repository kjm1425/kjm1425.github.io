Is <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/04/04/77113_HNnetsoldown_1.html">Network Solutions down again</a> for a third time this year?  It appears so.  Their web site is unreachable and the domain names I have stored in Network Solution's DNS do not resolve.  I know my servers are up because I can reach them by IP address.<br /><br />I've been happy with Network Solutions over the years, and I haven't minded paying the premium price for their service.  But if this trend continues then I may have no choice but to move my domain names to another registrar.<br /><br /><span style="color:red">Update:</span> After what appeared to be approximately a 30-minute outage, Network Solutions and its services are back online.<br /><br /><span style="color:red">Another Update:</span> Well, DNS is at least back.  Access to the <a href="http://www.networksolutions.com/">www.networksolutions.com</a> web site still appears to be a problem.  At least this confirms to me that the outage I saw a little while ago is related to problems at Network Solutions.<br /><br /><span style="color:red">Update:</span> <a href="http://www.networksolutions.com/">www.networksolutions.com</a> is back online as well.
