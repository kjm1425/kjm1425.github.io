I finally got around to setting up <a href="http://www.cvshome.org">CVS</a> at home with secured access using <a href="http://www.openssh.org">OpenSSH</a>.  The magic formula was <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a>, my favorite open source product of the moment.  And best of all I have <a href="http://russ.hn.org/viewcvs/">ViewCVS</a> running for browser based, read-only access to my CVS <a href="http://www.kirbyland.net/viewcvs/viewcvs.cgi">repository</a>.  WASTEDBoarding.com and Alt.System projects are already in the repository and are available for your viewing pleasure.
