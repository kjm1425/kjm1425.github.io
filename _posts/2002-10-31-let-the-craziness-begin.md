I have been away for the last few days visiting my very good friend Dave who is in the hospital right now.  I wanted to stay longer but I had to return to NYC, and on Halloween of all days.  I can tell you this Halloween seems to be craziness since I moved to this small town.  The neighborhood is jammed pack with people in costumes partying in the streets and waiting for the parade.  I can tell I will not get any sleep tonight.  The yelling and screaming has already started and it's only 8:30 pm.  Oh well...part of the joy of living in the West Village.  Too bad I am not into the festivities this year.
