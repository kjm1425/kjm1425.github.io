Day 4 on Killington was very nice.  The snow had soften up a bit.  Runs of the day: Rim in the morning and the Chute in the afternoon.  Also Great Bear was a blast and was the only trail I know of that still have evidence on Sunday's snow storm.  It's un-groomed and has soft powder bumps.

<br />Melanie and I leave Killington today.  She flies out to Brussels tonight and I have to finish work on my demos for next week's 5 day/5 city tour with Microsoft.  I had planned to hit the slopes this morning for a few quick runs before leaving because the weather forecast was calling for a wintery mix, but it's looks like that will not happen.  And if I am going out for only an hour then I want to see new snow or at least a change in the conditions.  Oh well.  We will be back very soon.
