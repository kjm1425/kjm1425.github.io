I thought about an interesting problem today.  Recently I updating the code behind this site so that all content is stored in XML.  But within the archive section, I have references to past posting that use the old URL.  These old URL now give a HTTP 404 error.  I have always thought it interesting when a site tries to determine the new URL for an old one.  I guess now I have a chance to try resolving that problem.  Hmmm, maybe I will look into doing that tomorrow.
