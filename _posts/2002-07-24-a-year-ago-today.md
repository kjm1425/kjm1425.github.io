A year ago today, Melanie and I were part of a group going to a Yankee's game.  Melanie and I separated from the group to find a shorter line for beer and hot dogs.  We got to our seats before the rest of the group and started talking.  We talked to each other for the rest of the game (and I was gracefully trying to stare at her long, tan, smooth, sexy legs).  I wonder if she ever caught me looking.

That night was the start of something between the two of us.  We started talking on the phone and e-mailing each other on a regular basis.  And even though she thought to herself "He's short" at a party a few days after *the* game, she agreed to go out with me.

A year ago today was the start of something very wonderful.  Had you told me I would be falling in love I would have said you were crazy.  And now I can't imagine going a single day without having Melanie in my life.
