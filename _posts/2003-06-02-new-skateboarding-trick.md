I learned a new skateboarding trick tonight.  I discovered if you attempt to roll over a little piece of metal tubing small enough that you don't even see it while riding, and you are going down a slight hill at a nice cruising speed, you can lock your back wheel, drag the piece of metal for 10 inches or so, and do a hand first slide on the asphalt as if your were sliding hands first into third base.  Can you say "Ouch?"  I did.  I really gotta start wearing pads.  And yes, I got back on the board and rode for a bit more.
