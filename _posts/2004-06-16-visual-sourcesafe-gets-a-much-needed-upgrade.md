title: 'Visual SourceSafe Gets a Much Needed Upgrade'
category: uncategorized

Microsoft has published the latest <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnvsent/html/vssmap.asp">Visual SourceSafe Roadmap</a>, which outlines where VSS is heading with the release of Visual SourceSafe 2005.  The new version will still be geared towards individual developers and small teams, i.e., teams with less than 5 developers but it will finally include remote access.  I'm glad to see VSS is finally getting a much needed upgrade but I doubt the new release will convince me to switch back from <a href="http://www.cvshome.org/">CVS</a>.<br /><br /><br />
