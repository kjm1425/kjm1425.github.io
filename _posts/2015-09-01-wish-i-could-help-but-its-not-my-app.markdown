A well known global company is using some open source code I wrote in one of their apps (yay!). Like a good company, they included my name and licensing information in app's about screen. Now I'm getting emails from one of the app's users seeking help with the app. The person thinks I wrote the app because my name appears in the licensing section. 

Definitely a first for me.
