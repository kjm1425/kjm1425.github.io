I'm not a healthy eat by any means, unless you consider eating large portions of fried chicken and pizza "healthy".  But I do like good food and that's what this new book promises.  It's a book devoted to [delicious gluten-free gourmet dessert recipes](http://www.suretalent-books.com/).  

##A Family Affair

My friend Mike, a [Cleveland base database developer](http://www.intersoftdevelopment.com/), and his wife wrote the book that is being sent to the printing facility within the next two week.  And I heard their daughter was also involved in making this book happen, a real family affair.

##How Do the Desserts Taste

I can't say yet since I haven't tried cooking any of the recipes yet.  But I know their recipes have won awards throughout the Cleveland area, and the way Mike has described the dessert to me make them sound mummy.  

Gluten-free or not, I'm looking forward to the book and trying some of these [delicious desserts](http://www.suretalent-books.com/).
