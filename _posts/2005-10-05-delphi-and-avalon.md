Back in April I blogged about <a href="http://www.thecave.com/archive/2005/04/06/my_delphi_2005_is_here.aspx">re-compiling Delphi source code from the 90's</a> into a .NET managed assembly.  Delphi (and possibly C++) is the only language I know of that provides this level of support.  While many Classic VB developers are porting legacy code to VB.NET or C#, I continue using Delphi code that has been unchanged for more than 7 years.<br /><br />One of the next big things coming out of Redmond that will affect Windows developers is Avalon, now called the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/windowsvista/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnlong/html/wpf101.asp">Windows Presentation <strike>Framework</strike> Foundation</a>.  While I image there will be some migration plan for .NET developers, I'm happy to see Borland has <a href="http://blogs.borland.com/davidi/archive/2005/10/03/21548.aspx">plans to implement VCL for Avalon in 2007</a>.  <br /><br />Based on my experience of moving Delphi code to .NET, I'm confident that Delphi code I write today as well as code I've written over the years will require little to no change with I'm ready to adopt the new presentation framework from Microsoft.
