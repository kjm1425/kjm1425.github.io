One of the items on my never ending to-do list is to install a wiki for internal use at <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/">White Peak Software</a>.  It's been on my list for over a year to do but it seems I never have the time.  Last week I saw the internal wiki of another small software company and thought to myself, "I need to do the same."  So today I decided to take a break from my normal work to install a wiki.<br /><br />There are a lot of different wiki software options available so I started by reviewing the popular ones at <a href="http://www.wikimatrix.org/">WikiMatrix</a>.  This site even has a <a href="http://www.wikimatrix.org/wizard.php">Wiki Choice Wizard</a> that helps find a wiki software package based on requirement needs.<br /><br />The selection criteria was simple.  I need something that will run on a Windows server under IIS and does not require a database.  The content should be stored in the file system in case a need arises that requires access to the data outside of the wiki software.  The software I settled on is <a href="http://wiki.splitbrain.org/wiki:dokuwiki">DokuWiki</a>.<br /><br />DokuWiki is written in PHP so my first step was to download the latest version of <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a>.  A Windows installer is provided that will not only install PHP but configure IIS to use PHP.  The installer ran without a problem, which made me very happy.<br /><br />Next I downloaded the DokuWiki software and un-archived the tar file.  I setup a wiki folder and copied the DokuWiki to the new folder.  I created a new web site using the IIS management console and pointed the web site to the wiki folder.  Within a few minutes, from installing PHP to copying the DokuWiki files to setting up the web site, the wiki site was up and running.<br /><br />The more time consuming part has been adding content to the wiki site.  I started by creating a new start page with links to various White Peak Software resources.  I also setup a "Clients" wiki page.  From there I started adding content about each client and client project.  Even after 3 hours I haven't made it very far.  There's too much information to add.  I imagine I will be adding content off and on for the next few weeks.<br /><br />The great thing about having the wiki is that White Peak Software now has single point of reference for accessing WPS information.  When a new sub-contractor comes on board, or even if I am looking for information about a particular project, the wiki site provides easy access to the needed information.  I'm glad I finally took the time to get this started.
