Today it occurred to me that I never mentioned the arrival of my new son, Rowan Andrew Turner.  It slipped my mind because I have been blogging over at the Rowan T site.  But that's no reason not to mention his arrive here.  So Rowan, aka Baby T, is here!  And he is a bundle of joy.  You can read more about Rowan, see pictures, etc, at his blog site <a href="http://RowanTurner.net">http://RowanTurner.net</a>.
