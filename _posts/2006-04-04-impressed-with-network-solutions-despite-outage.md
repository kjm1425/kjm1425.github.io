title: 'Impressed With Network Solutions Despite Outage'
category: business

I mentioned earlier that <a href="http://www.networksolutions.com/">Network Solutions</a> was experiencing an outage that effective some of my domain names.  The problem was resolved and all was right in the world again.  Then this evening I got a call from Network Solutions apologizing for the outage.  Wow!  Nice touch.  Kudo to Network Solutions for making this one customer feel special.
