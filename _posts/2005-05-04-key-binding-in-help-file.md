title: 'Key Binding in Help File'

I recently posted a list of Delphi key bindings.  I discovered most of the bindings through trial and error or by inspecting the various menus.  I had originally I searched the help file and browsed the help file index but I couldn't find the list of key binding.  I never thought to look under the contents.  I figure if I can't find it in the index or search it must not exist.  But it does.  I think I need to spend more time browsing the help file through the content tab and not rely so much on index and search.
