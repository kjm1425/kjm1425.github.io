At White Peak, we use <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBUGZ/">FogBugz</a> Version 4.0 to track issues and manage projects.  It's been in use for a week now and I have to say it is the best issue tracking application I have ever used.  What makes it so great is its simple interface.  For instance, from within a case I can reference another case by including the text "case" followed by the case number (i.e., case 20).  The software automatically sets a two-way hyperlink between the cases.<br /><br />If you are looking for a powerful yet easy-to-use project management and issue tracking tool, I highly recommend you check out FogBugz.
