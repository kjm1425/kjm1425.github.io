For grins I decided to install the latest version of <a href="http://www.redhat.com/">RedHat</a> Linux version 9 and play with <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/">Mono</a>.  Mono is an open source effort to port the .NET Framework to other platforms.  Once I had everything installed, which was fairly simple and straight forward, I wrote a sample console application using C#.  It compiled and ran without a problem.  <br /><br />For fun, I decided to copy the .exe to Windows XP and run the same program under Microsoft's .NET Framework.  I was delighted to see that the program ran without the need to re-compile.  I also copied a program to RedHat that I had compiled using Microsoft's .NET Framework 1.1.  It ran under Mono without a problem.<br /><br />There are still features of the .NET Framework not yet implemented under Mono, but there is a lot that is there.  Even a test of XmlSerialization ran without a problem.  And best of all, I was able to run programs under the two different operating systems without the need to recompile.  Now how sweet is that!<br /><br />
