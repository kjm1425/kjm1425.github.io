My snowboard season is finally over, and it ends with me wanting more.  This weekend in Killington was one of the best times on the slope for me this season.  And to add to the great snow, the weekend was made a bit better by spending time with the Davis's.  The turkey was delich and the ham was more than heavenly.  But this posting is about the snow.
<br />
<br />Saturday was overcast and warm with slope side temps in the 50's.  The snow was soft with lots of nice banks on the bumps.  Saturday felt like surfing over and over without having to wait for the perfect wave.  The half pipe was surprisingly good given the warm weather and I almost made it to the top of the 15 foot wall more than once.
<br />
<br />Sunday was the best of the two days.  Sunny and warm.  Temps in the 60's during the morning and accordingly the Killington snow report, in the 70's during the afternoon.  Definitely t-shirt weather.  The surface condition was snow in most places, bare in others.  And there was also the occasional water puddle.  My favorite part of the day was smashing through soft bumps and face spraying myself with snow.
<br />
<br />I got 32 days on the slopes and Melanie made her record high of 27 days spread over a long, 5 month season.  Somehow Melanie and I missed the powder all season.  I felt like I was riding the same stuff all season, be it in Whistler or Killington.  But this weekend reminded me how much fun snowboarding is.  And it left me wanting more.  I can't think of a better way to end the season.
