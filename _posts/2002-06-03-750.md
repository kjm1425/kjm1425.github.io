I now have an open source project area on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/photoroom/">SourceForge.net</a> for my Photo Room software.  Let me know if you care to contribute to the effort.  You can see Photo Room in action at <a href="http://www.wastedboarding.com/photoroom/">WASTEDBoarding.com</a>.
