A lot has happened since my last posting.  As usual my life has been very busy.  I took a sick day from work on December 22 to snowboard during the day and watch the Lord of the Rings.  Three years in a row.  I'm sure Melanie is glad the movie was only a trilogy.  <br /><br />For my birthday and Christmas Melanie gave me a couple of new Xbox games, <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/tonyhawksunderground/default.htm">Tony Hawk's Underground</a> and <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-us/pgr2/default.htm">Project Gotham Racing 2</a>.  Both rock!  THUG's story mode is very addicting and PGR2 is much better than I expected.  And I really like the Xbox Live support in PGR2.<br /><br />Melanie and I spent the holidays with her family.  Lots of food and good cheer.  And tons of presents.  The Davis's really get into the gift giving thing during the holidays.<br /><br />And lastly, Melanie and I are staying in NYC for the New Years.  We are hosting a small wine tasting event Wednesday night and ringing in the New Years with some friends.<br /><br /><br />
