Apparent the White Peak install of InstantForum.NET 4.0 is tied directly to the availability an InstantASP server.  Unfortunately it seems the InstantASP server is down and as a result the White Peak Software Support Forums is down as well.  I am working with the vendor to resolve the problem as quickly as possible and to hopefully ensure this never happens again.
