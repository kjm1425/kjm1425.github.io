As I am sitting on the plane heading to Dallas, I thought it would be fun to share my day with others.  Consider it as a day in the life of a consultant.
<br />
<br />4:15 am: Wake up, shower, and pack a change of clothes and my laptop.
<br />5:15 am: Kiss Melanie goodbye, head out the door and hail a cab.
<br />5:45 am: Pickup the car from Avis.
<br />6:00 am: Leaving the Holland Tunnel and looking for the New Jersey Turnpike.
<br />8:00 am: Arrive in Malvern PA right outside of Philly.
<br />8:15 am: Driving around looking for food.  I'm straving.
<br />8:20 am: Stop at a Circle K for breakfast...mmmm, powder doughnuts.
<br />8:30 am: Arrive at Microsoft's Philly office.
<br />9:00 am: Meet with customer.  Discuss fun, geeky stuff.
<br />11:50 am: Call Melanie to say hi.
<br />3:30 pm: Leave meeting.  Was told it will take 1.5 hours to get to the airport.
<br />3:40 pm: Call Melanie again.
<br />4:30 pm: Return car to Avis.
<br />4:45 pm: Arrive at the airport with time to spare.
<br />5:50 pm: Call Melanie one last time.  She is flying out to Paris tonight.
<br />6:00 pm: Take off to Dallas.
<br />10:00 pm: Arrive in Dallas and take taxi to the hotel.
<br />10:25 pm: Call the hotel.  The cabbie is lost.
<br />10:40 pm: Check into the hotel.
<br />10:50 pm: Order pizza and make a few phone calls.
<br />11:00 pm: Check e-mail.
<br />12:00 am: Finally, the pizza is here.
<br />12:20 am: Tummy is full.  Time for bed.
<br />12:30 am: Fall asleep.
<br />
<br />That was my day.  And it all starts all over again at 6:00 am.
