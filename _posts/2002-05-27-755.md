Melanie and I just returned from [East Durham](http://www.east-durham.org/) in the Catkills of New York state.  We were there to enjoy beers and music at the 25th Annual East Durham Irish Festival.  Headlining the festival was the Saw Doctors.  Other bands appearing included The Prodigals, The Glengarry Bhoys, Andy Cooney Band, and more.  My favorite by far was Ontario Canada's [Glengarry Bhoys](http://www.glengarrybhoys.com/).  These cats really got the crowd shaking, moving, and jumping.

Despite some transportation problems this turned out to be a great weekend.  We joined the Early family, an Irish family that have been friends of Melanie's for years, on our trek up state.  There is never a dull (or quiet) moment with the Early family and friends.  Activities around the house were non-stop.  And the Shepherd's Pie has never been better!  I can't wait to join everyone next year.
