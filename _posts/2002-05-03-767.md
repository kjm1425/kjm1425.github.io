Not like anyone really cares, but I am heading out of town again.  KC last weekend.  NYC this week.  And early tomorrow Melanie and I will be heading off to Jamaica for some fun in the sun.  We will be stopping over in Memphis mid-week to visit with friends and family, and to watch my sister get married.  It's hard to believe she is not a kid any more.
