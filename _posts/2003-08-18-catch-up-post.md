Power returned to the West Village Friday afternoon, just in time for Melanie and I to leave the city.  We headed to Lake George in upstate New York for a weekend getaway at Camp Murphy.  It was great seeing everyone over the weekend.  We didn't want to leave but we had too.  I'll have photos posted in the gallery later today.
