Going back to a programming language that you have not touched in years is hard.  Syntax is easy, it comes back quickly.  But trying to remember all the details, runtime library calls, and so on can be a real brain buster.  And add to that that Delphi has had many improvements since 2000 in its VCL and runtime library.  <br /><br />It's funny how knowledge will leak from your brain when the knowledge hasn't been referenced in years.  It's like opening a jar of whatever that hasn't been opened in years only to find that much of the content has evaporated.
