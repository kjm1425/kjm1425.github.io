Last night Melanie, her sister Brenna, and I saw the new Broadway musical <a href="http://www.hairsprayonbroadway.com/">Hairspray</a> based on the John Waters' movie of the <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0095270">same name</a>.  The show set in Baltimore, 1962, was not only hilarious but energetic, up-beat, and quite entertaining.  The story is about a plump teenage girl who fights for racial equality and integration by appearing as a regular on a local TV dance show.  What's more funny than that?  Well, a lot of things I guess but this show is still very funny.  And <a href="http://www.plump.com/harvbio.htm">Harvery Fierstein</a> is simply <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Set/9625/">divine</a> as Edna Turnblad.
