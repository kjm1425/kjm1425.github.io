Last week Melanie and I made a very special trip to Memphis.  My sister Renay and her husband Tommie were expecting the delivery of their first born.  Renay was admitted to the hospital around 6:30 am and Baby Noah decided to make his appearance some 13 hours later.  Family and friends were able to meet Noah only a short two hours later.  It was amazing to think that Melanie and I both got to hold Noah only hours after being brought into this world.<br /><br />Pictures available in the <a href="http://www.thecave.com/gallery.aspx">gallery</a>.
