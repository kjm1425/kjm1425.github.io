title: 'Yet Another Reason to Use Eudora'

I just read an <a href="http://reviews-zdnet.com.com/AnchorDesk/4520-7297_16-5138088.html?tag=adts">article</a> about a new service called <a href="http://www.didtheyreadit.com/">DidTheyReadIt</a>.  In a nutshell, this service places a small Web bug in HTML formatted e-mails that acts as a tracking device.  When the e-mail recipient reads the e-mail a script on the DidTheyReadIt site logs the action.  It will even log how long it took to read the e-mail message.  Based on logged information the e-mail sender can know if you read the e-mail or not.  Fortunately this service only works with e-mail readers that support HTML formatted e-mails, which is something I have never liked.  Unfortunately most people view e-mail message as HTML.
<br />
<br />HTML e-mails look nice but too much can happen behind the scenes that the message reader does not know about such as tracking when the e-mail message was read.  I use <a href="http://www.eudora.com/">Eudora</a> as my preferred e-mail reader.  It allows me to turn off viewing e-mail as HTML.  I can still see the e-mail and read it, but it is not rendered as HTML.  This means the e-mail message might not look as nice but it also means there is no unknown activity happening behinds the scenes when I read the e-mail.  And I still have the option for view the message as HTML if I like.
