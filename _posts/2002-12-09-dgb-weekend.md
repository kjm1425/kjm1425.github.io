I have return to rainy Florida after attending the first ever <a href="http://www.wastedboarding.com/home/tripdetail.wasted?tid=6">DGB Killington Weekend</a>.  What a great weekend!  Skiing and riding, beer and pizza.  What more can a group of guys ask for?
<br />
<br />We shredded slopes of Killington from peak to peak Saturday including Beer Mountain, and threw back a few cold ones at the Outback for apre' ski.  We ended the night with a few rounds of <a href="http://www.playbeirut.net/">Beirut</a> where Team Andy and Josh took the first game only to be stomped by Team Fernado and Kirby, who were calling their shots and landin' em in game two.  But the match would be won by Team Andy and Josh who were landing double sinkers and clearing the other end of the team in a matter of minutes.
<br />
<br />Sunday was a return to the Killington slopes with a smaller crowd and better snow conditions.  The snow was falling and there were wind gusts so strong that I almost fell over a couple of times.  Andy was slammed to the ground by an out of control snowboarder.  Fernado was working on technique.  And Josh and I were making plans to take out the other two on the lifts.
<br />
<br />Overall it was a great time with great guys.
