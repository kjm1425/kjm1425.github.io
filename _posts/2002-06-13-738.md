It's funny how easy it is to forget things you have worked on in the past.  A few months ago I started work on an <a href="http://www.kirbyland.net/pageframework/">idea for a presentation framework</a> for ASP.NET.  I had forgotten about it until a friend reminded me of it earlier today.
<br />
<br />I only spent a few hours on it but I remember the work being fun.  It uses an Http module to simulate web page inheritance for the purpose of controlling a site's look and feel from a centralize location.  Take a look, download the source, and let me know what you think.
