Today I learned about an old PSA aired in the NYC area called <a href="http://www.chrisdiclerico.com/mt/archives/000760.php">We're Not Candy</a>.  I've heard the audio, which is hilarious.  But I really want to see the video.  I was told the song is sung by little pills.  Shoot me an e-mail if you have a copy of the video.
