Heading out to Vegas within the hour.  It's the start of my bachelor party weekend Vegas style.  I hate the fact that I have to take "nice" clothes.  I thought Vegas was a jeans and t-shirt type of place but I guess I was wrong.  It's also going to be hot.  Very hot!  Like 101 for a high!  All this negative vibe at the start of my bachelor party?  I need a beer.  Time to get started.  I'll post the stories I can share when I get back, which hopefully there will be no postable stories.  <i>Just kidding Melanie.</i><br /><br />On an unrelated note, I am once again having problems with Blogger.  Second time this week.  Was the sale to goggle.com a good thing or a bad thing?  I'm starting to wonder.  Anyway, this posting was original planned for the wedding site but because of problems I'm not able to post there.  And hopefully posting via e-mail will work.<br /><br />
