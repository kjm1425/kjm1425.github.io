Earlier tonight I setup a new Twitter account that tweets a link each time I publish a new post here at thecave.com. The new Twitter account is [@thecave_com][1]. Of course now that this is setup, I'm wondering...Do I really need a separate Twitter account, or should I just tweet the links from my [@kirbyt][2] account?

I guess I will keep the two separate accounts, and I'll retweet via @kirbyt any links that I feel might be of greater interest, which is basically what I've always done. So if you want to know each time a new post is published, follow @thecave_com. Otherwise just keep doing what you've been doing.
