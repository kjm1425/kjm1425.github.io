After 5 days in 5 cities, I am finally flying home.  The week has been fun albeit tiring with days running 14 to 16 hours.  Admittedly, even with the long days this was one of those weeks that left me thinking "I like my job."  Granted, I would not want to do this every week.
<br />
<br />Speaking at the councils definitely improved my public speaking skills and gave me increased confidence along with an ego boost.  If giving the opportunity, I would definitely do it again.

One of which was <a href="http://orlando.diningguide.net/data/d101871.htm">Vito's Chop House</a> in Orlando.  The  steaks were amazing and mine was perfectly cooked to my preference, which is hard given that I prefer blue or black blue as they call it at Vito's.  The <a href="http://www.hardrock.com/locations/hotels/orlando/">Hard Rock Hotel</a> in Orlando was also a highlight and is a very cool hotel.  Sadly we did not get to stay the night though.  Guess Melanie and I will have to make a weekend trip to Orlando soon.  I know where we will be eating and staying.  And the Renaissance Hotel in Boca was great and offered excellent wireless access to the Internet for free.  However, I do not recommend the restaurant Porter's, which is attached to the hotel.

<br />My favorite comment from the week happened when Tom asked the group "What is a 'dirty read'?"  I whispered Hustler and Sluts with Big Thingies.  When asked "And what is bad about dirty reads?" Ian whispered "Sticky pages."  LOL.  Oh too funny.  Guess you have to be a geek to get it.
