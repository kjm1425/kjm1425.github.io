Recently I mentioned the RSS feed for this site had a bug in it.  The link for each blog item was incorrect.  The reason this happened is because I was using Blogger.com to generate the rss.xml file and Blogger had no way of knowing the link used on the site.  I finally fixed this today but it means Blogger is no longer generating the XML file.  It also means the URL to the RSS feed has changed.<br /><br />If you are reading this blog from an RSS-based aggregator you will need to update the URL for the feed.  The new URL is:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.thecave.com/rss.aspx">http://www.thecave.com/rss.aspx</a>
