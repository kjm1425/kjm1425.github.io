I'm in the final stagings of writing my book, and to help out, the wife gave me the okay to spend a few days in Vermont along. No wife. No kid. Just me and my laptop.

The trip to Vermont has, so far, been great. It's given me the time I need to make some real progress on the completing the book. It's also given me time to do things I don't normal get to do anymore.

Acknowledgement: Yes, I know what follows will likely anger the wife, but hey, I'm just trying to [keep it real](http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/2c8c4b3b58/chappelle-show-when-keeping-it-real-goes-wrong-1).

Things I've done this weekend that I normally don't do:
- Write code for hours on end...uninterrupted.
- Work the book...uninterrupted.
- Go to sleep when I want, but more importantly wake up when I want.
- Have hours of peace and quiet. No talking. No socializing with others.
- And best of all, take a shower each day.

The combination of sleep and alone time is just want I needed. And the daily showers, icing on the cake.

Thanks Melanie and Rowan for giving me this time.

Update: I do miss having reliable high-speed Internet access.
