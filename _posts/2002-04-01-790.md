title: 'Another Snowboarding Season Comes to an End'

It's a sad day.  I finally stored my snowboard gear away.  At least I had an incredible season with 35 days riding the slopes.  <a href="http://www.wastedboarding.com/">WASTED</a> was great and hopefully I will get around to posting all the photos online.  I have collected some 270 photos from the various people who attended WASTED.  The rest of the season included trips with Melanie to Killington, Vermont.  And we ended the season together with one last wonderful weekend in <a href="http:/www.whistler-blackcomb.com/">Whistler</a>.  It was very hard to leave.  But I guess there is always next year.
