Okay, so I am reading every piece of information I can find on the <a href="http://www.freebord.com/">Freebord</a> thinking to myself I gotta get me one of these things.  (Freebord is a snowboard for the streets.) Then I start thinking Manhattan is too flat.  I need some hills and less traffic before I will ride the slopes of Manhattan.  Beside a skateboard is more idea for urban riding.  But than I found this web called <a href="http://www.longboardmaps.com/">LongBoardMaps.com</a>.  Go figure.  The Internet has everything.  And sure enough, there is a list of runs in <a href="http://www.longboardmaps.com/browse.php?lpid=4">Manhattan</a>.  And I know there is little downtown traffic late at night.  Now I just need a crew to ride with 'cause riding alone is just not as much fun.
