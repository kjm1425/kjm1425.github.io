[Commentary: The Upcoming GNOME Monarchy of Mono - OSNews.com](http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=5746&amp;foo=Commentary:%20The%20Upcoming%20GNOME%20Monarchy%20of%20Mono%2001-21-2004): "Unix was originally all about not being... Multics. If Mono is to follow a similar nomenclature (just for the kicks), we have to talk about Mono's upcoming 'monopolization' and 'monarchy' in the next generation of the Unix programming land. Your see, if everything goes well, in 2 to 3 years most new Gnome user/desktop applications will be written --hopefully-- in Mono and C#. "
