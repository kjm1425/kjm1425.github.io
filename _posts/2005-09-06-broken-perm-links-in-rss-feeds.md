title: 'Broken Perm Links in RSS Feeds'
category: uncategorized
---

I recently changed the way perm links are generated for my blog entries.  However, I totally forgot about making the change to my RSS feed.  I guess that's what happens when you introduce a technology like RSS and it runs problem free for months if not years.  Still, that's no excuse for overlooking the RSS feed with regard to the new perm links.<br /><br />I will have a fix in place within a couple of days.  Sorry it can't be sooner but my plate is full at the moment and since that has been no complaints it's not a top priority issue.<br /><br />My apologies to those of you reading the blog through an RSS reader.
