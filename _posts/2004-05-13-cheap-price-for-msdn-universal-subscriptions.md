title: 'Cheap price for MSDN Universal subscriptions'
category: uncategorized
---

[Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/) has some great prices on MSDN Universal subscriptions.  A [first time subscription](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=whitepeaksoft-20&amp;path=tg/detail/-/B00005NGPB/qid%3D1084453776/sr%3D8-1) is only $2399 USD saving more than $400 USD over Microsoft's price.  The [upgrade](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=whitepeaksoft-20&amp;path=tg/detail/-/B00005NGPA/qid%3D1084453776/sr%3D8-2) price is $1974.99 USD.  I think these prices are for U.S. customers only.
