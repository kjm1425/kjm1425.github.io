I am finally working on an interesting customer project with some guys from Microsoft.  One of the coolest things about the project is how we are using WSDL to describe services and generating code for the service.  My latest task is to spec out how to describe bindings for .NET remoted services using alternative channels, i.e., not HTTP or TCP, in WSDL.  It's fun to hack up the XML then write a console app to try it out.
