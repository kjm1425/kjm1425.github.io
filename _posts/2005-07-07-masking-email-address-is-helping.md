title: 'Masking Email Address is Helping'

For the last 24 hours I have tracked incoming spam to my email address.  During that time I received a total of 225 spam messages.  163 of these messages were properly filtered on the server as spam, but unfortunately 62 spam messages were not caught by the server.  This means I need to tweak the server settings more.  At one time my server caught approximately 90% of incoming spam which no longer seems to be the case.<br /><br />Good news is 54 of the 62 spam messages were caught by my email client.  The other good news is I am seeing a major reduction in total spam received since I started <a href="/archive/2005/06/25/masking_addresses_to_prevent_email_harvesting.aspx">masking my email address</a>.
