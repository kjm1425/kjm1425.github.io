So I am finally rockin' it with my new iPod, but I have quickly learned that I wish I had gotten the 20 gig model.  10 gigs is just not enough space for me.  Guess I will have to deal with it.  Besides, the case for the 10 gig model is smaller than the 20 gig model, which is the reason I wanted the 10 gig model in the first place.
<br />
<br />Oh, I will say one other thing...the firewire connection is super fast.  I can copy gigs of MP3 to my iPod in a matter of minutes.  Now that really rocks.
