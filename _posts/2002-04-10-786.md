The hard drive of my daily used laptop kicked the bucket last Friday.  I finally got a replacement drive and now I am going through the painful process of re-installing software.  But one piece of software is making this more painful than usual, Visual Studio.NET.
<br />
<br />I for one am a fan of VS.NET.  It seems Microsoft has finally gotten it right.  But this lovely piece of software is just too damn big.  The install takes too long and the slightest problem can cause the installation process to take longer.  I have been working to install VS.NET since 3 pm yesterday with numerous failed attempts.  Funny how Borland's Delphi ever did this to me.
