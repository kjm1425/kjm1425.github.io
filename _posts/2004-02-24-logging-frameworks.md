Today I spent time comparing Logging frameworks.  I looked at <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4net/">log4net</a> and one developed internally by my employer.  log4net is the clear winner.  It is easier to setup and configure.  And it has features to watch for configuration changes so you can change log settings without restarting your application.  Sadly though I may be "forced" to use the Logging framework developed internally. <br /><br /><br />
