title: 'A Computer Crash of a Different Color'

[My tweet from Saturday night](http://twitter.com/kirbyt/statuses/802958985) deserves a follow up response, especially since a few folks have asked "What happened?"

Nothing major happened.  We had a few people over for dinner.  I needed a cable, which I keep in a milk crate in the top of a closet.  As I pulled down the crate a monitor on the same shelve started to fall.  I reached for monitor but with the crate in hand and standing on a short stool I lost my balance and fell.  Unfortunately I hit my head on a piece of computer equipment opening a short but deep gash next to my eye.  (Haha, I crashed into a computer instead of the computer crashing on me.)

There was plenty of blood and the gash looked deep enough that I knew I needed stitches.  So off to the hospital for a short ER visit and a few stitches.  I returned home to a hungry group of guests.  Threw some chicken on the grill and continued the fun.  Despite the minor mishap the small gathering was a success.
