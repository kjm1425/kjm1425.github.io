[White Peak Software](http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/) is 3 years ago today.  What an amazing ride it has been over the last 3 years.  It's almost hard to believe 3 years has past.

White Peak was start a month after I got married.  Talk about major life change.  Nothing like getting married and starting a new business at the same time to make life interesting.  I wonder what my wife was thinking back then.  She was dating an employed, well paid guy, but married an paid computer geek with big dreams of the ultimate life style.

Lucky for me my wife shares my hopes and dreams of the ultimate life style, and she is one of the main reasons White Peak Software can celebrate its 3 year old birthday today.  This would not have happened without her love and support.

When I started White Peak the plan was to provide consulting services to businesses.  After much soul searching, and with help for a business coach (thanks Brian!), I realized I really wanted to have a product company.  This is something I have dreamt of doing since the time I first slang code for a living \(around 1985 - boy, I'm getting old\).

So the plan for White Peak is to publish useful software products.  It's been harder than I expected and is taking longer than expected.  But that's fine because with each passing year I am one step closer to the primary reason for starting White Peak Software, to support a particular life style.

White Peak Software is about building a life style for me, my wife, and \(one day\) our family.  It's not about building a large software company.  It's about having the freedom to spend time with each other, traveling, and going on adventures.  Sure, it's nice to make a few extra dollars and I'm happy to see White Peak's revenue grow each year, but the thing I really like is the freedom I have.  As they say in the credit card commercials, it's priceless.

There is still a long road ahead for White Peak Software, and more work is needed to get closer to the ultimate life style.  3 years ago I was more pessimistic more unsure about the future.  But today I look back on the accomplishments over the last 3 years and I'm more optimistic more sure about the future and what it holds for me, my family, and White Peak Software.

Happy birthday [White Peak](http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/).
