Finally!  My blog is working.
<br />
<br />Following the lead of great minds such as <a href="http://www.iunknown.com">John Lam</a>, <a href="http://www.pocketsoap.com/weblog/index.html">Simon Fell</a>, and <a href="http://www.mickjones.com">Mike "call me Mick" Jones</a>, I have decided to change thecave.com to my own personal web log.  Years ago I had high hopes of thecave.com becoming an online community for Windows developers but it never happened.  And as a result, it has been years since thecave.com was updated.
<br />
<br />So if you are interested in what I have to say, stories of my travels, and more, stay tuned to the all new thecave.com.  PS: the old programmer's hideout is still available from the links section on the right.
