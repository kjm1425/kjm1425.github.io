I biggest compliant, and possibly our only compliant, since moving to the Boston area is driving in the Boston area.  I some times think the area has the worse drivers in the Nation, but it's not the fault of the drivers.  Poor signage...actually the lack of street signs in many places...construction, construction, construction, poor markings on the roads, and more have probably contributed to creating bad drivers.  Just the other day I saw two slow speed accidents.  Yes, cars travelling at about walking speed collided.  I didn't see this happen once, but twice within a 30 minutes time period.<br /><br />It's no surprise to me that the Boston area doesn't even have a safety ranking in the AllState <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12954585/">best driver report for 2006</a>.  Okay, to be fair <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12948178/">AllState does not issue car insurance here</a> which is why the Boston area is not on the report.  But still.<br /><br />So what's the point of this blog entry?  Simple.  I cracked up this morning when I read <a href="http://software.ericsink.com/">Erik Sink</a>'s entry on <a href="http://software.ericsink.com/entries/TechEd_2006_Report.html">Notes from TechEd in Boston</a>.  Further proof that driving in the Boston area is a real pain.
