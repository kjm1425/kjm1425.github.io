Just a reminder, the photo gallery and WCAV Radio are both offline until I get DSL setup in the apartment.  And since I am <a href="http://www.wastedboarding.com/wastedblog/archive.aspx?archive/2003_01_19_archive.ascx#90228646">leaving for Whistler</a> next week, it will probably be around the end of February before the server is back online.  Sorry for the delay but that's life.
