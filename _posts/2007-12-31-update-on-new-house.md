I can honestly say I have bitten off more than I can chew when it comes to prepping the new house for our move in.  I have developed a new hatred for wallpaper.  Pulling down wallpaper and prepping the walls for priming is a very time consuming process.  But with luck I should be ready to start priming walls by Thursday.
