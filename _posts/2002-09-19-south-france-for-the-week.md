title: 'South France for the week'

It's been two weeks since Melanie and my last getaway so it is definitely time for another one.  Our last getaway was a weekend at Camp Murphy in Lake George.  What a blast that was!
<br />
<br />For this getaway, Melanie and I are heading to the southern part of France.  We are starting and ending the trip in Nice but we also plan to visit the town where she studied for a year.  The town is pronounced "X" but I am sure there are more letters in the town's name.  If we come back it will be the end of next week.  And that is <b>if</b> we come back.
<br />
<br />I will not be reachable during this getaway.  My mobile will not work in France and I have no plans to check e-mail.  So no emergencies over the next week.  Everyone say safe and enjoy life.  And dream about the upcoming winter and SNOWBOARDING!
