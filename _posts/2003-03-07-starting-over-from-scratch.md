Okay, I'm depressed.  Next week I am joining Microsoft for a 5 day/5 city tour to talk about interop with Web services.  I have spent the last couple of days writing sample code for my demos and was nearing completion when I lost everything.
<br />
<br />How did I lost it all?  Simple.  I re-ran the wstkconfig.bat from the IBM Web Services Toolkit to deploy the last Web service I planned to show.  The other code was manually deployed but this time I decided to use the configuration tool just for fun.  Little did I know it would delete the entire webapps/wstk directory, which contained the majority of my code that I manually deployed.  All that work gone.  Guess it's time to start over.
<br />
<br />Be warned: If using the IBM Web Services Toolkit, keep your original source in a safe place on the hard drive.  That is, keep it in a place not under the live webapps.
