I stand corrected.  I was able to find a <a href="http://www.shop.intuit.com/commerce/catalog/product.jhtml;jsessionid=U15PHHFJUKZR2CQIBMVRZNQKBAFSOF4K?sellLocation=CATALOG%2FCATEGORY.cat60004.overview.m251166%2FFeaturedProducts.2%2F0000000000001402409&amp;lid=0000000000001402409&amp;prodId=prod0000000000005948713">desktop version</a> of TurboTax but I didn't find it from the www.turbotax.com website.  Instead I found it from the www.intuit.com website.  Go figure.
<br />
<br /><span style="color:red">Update:</span> I decided to give TurboTax one more chance before going to a professional but not the web version.  Instead I order my old, familiar friend, the desktop version.  Hopefully the experience will be much better and I can get our taxes done.
