I want an easy way to share certain posts to social media sites, such as Facebook and Twitter, at the time I publish the post. The more I can automate, the better. The problem is this site is a static HTML site generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com). 

So how do I automatically share a post to Facebook or Twitter? That’s what I’m experimenting with right now, and this post is my test post.

## What’s Going On

For the techies reading this, here’s what I’m doing. 

First, I updated my tags plugin to generate an RSS feed file for each tag. Next, I setup [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com) to monitor the feed files for the tags "facebook" and "twitter". When IFTTT detects a new feed file item (i.e., a new blog post), it will post the item to the appropriate social media site. If I want to share a post to Facebook, I simply tag it with "facebook". And if I want to share the post on Twitter, I tag it with "twitter". 

The [source code for this site](https://github.com/kirbyt/site-www-thecave-com) is available on [Github](https://github.com/kirbyt/site-www-thecave-com) for those who want to look under the hood.

Now to start work on the hard part...writing more blog posts.
