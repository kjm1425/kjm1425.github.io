title: 'Turning Off HTML Formatting in BDS2006'

I often rave about BDS2006 but not today.  Today this fine IDE is really annoying me.  I'm editing some ASP.NET User Controls (.ascx) using the markup editor.  Every time I save the changes the editor reformats the HTML to unformatted HTML.  Not only that it is inserting new HTML into the file such as empty <p></p> tags!  It's annoying me so much I'm considering re-installing Visual Studio 2003.<br /><br />I don't recall having this problem with BDS2005 and admittedly this is the first time I have done any major ASP.NET work in BDS2006.  Anyone know of a way to turn OFF HTML formatting in BDS2006?
