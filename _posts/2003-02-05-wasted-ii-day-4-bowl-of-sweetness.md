Day 4: Bowl of Sweetness:
    
Still no new snow but we had new arrivals today.  Karen, Charlie, Therese, and Justin joined us on the slopes of Whistler.  Today was about the bowls as we spent most of our time in them.  The drop in to Low Roll was definitely the most challenge.  And I will be the first to admit I slid in over the lip on my butt.  Camelback and Bagel Bowl were the runs of the day where the snow was soft and bumpy.
