Things are really busy for me right now.  I've just started two separate customer projects, sales of [Killink CSV](http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/killink-csv.aspx) and [SMTP Diagnostics](http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/smtp-diagnostics.aspx) are climbing, and I've been doing a [lot of travel](http://www.thecave.com/archive/2007/01/26/my_trips_in_2007.aspx).  But one thing has me really excited.  I ordered a [MacBook Pro](http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/) and it's expected to arrive in a couple of days.

I need a beefy laptop for the work I'll be doing while on the road.  I compared prices, specs, etc with different vendors (Dell, HP, Apple) and the MacBook Pro won.

But wait!  Aren't you a Windows developer?  Yes, I am and I will continue to write software for Windows.  The only difference is I will be doing it from my shinny new MacBook Pro.  Yep, [another Delphi developer moves to the Mac](http://chrisbensen.blogspot.com/2007/07/running-windows-and-delphi-on-mac.html).

Another reason for the switch is VMware's upcoming virtualization software called [Fusion](http://www.vmware.com/mac/).  It's still in beta but looks very promising.  As a matter of fact check out this Fusion feature called [Unity](http://www.youtube.com/embed/JIApJMzGzDQ).

Now that's dang cool.
