After fighting with a few last minute issues when running under Vista, <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/killink-csv.aspx">Killink CSV 1.9</a> was finally released last night.  I wasn't able to get all the changes I wanted into this release but I got a good number of them.  The biggest change is the new sort feature.  Users are now able to sort their delimited text data using Killink CSV.  Also included in this release is improved navigation (quickly jump to the top, bottom, left, and right most item using Ctrl+Arrow key combinations) and more ways to select values (Shift+Click to select a range of columns or rows, Ctrl+Shift+Arrow keys to select blocks of items from the active cell).  And finally the ability to paste a value to multiple cells simply by selecting a block of cells.<br /><br />This release was long overdue.  But I'm hoping users will find the wait worth well.  Please read the <a href="http://www.whitepeaksoftware.com/help-killink-csv/revisionhistory.html">revision history</a> for a complete list of changes.<br /><br />One feature that did not make this release is Unicode support.  I really wanted to include this feature in version 1.9 but it is taking more time to implement than planned.  So instead of delaying the other features I decided to release version 1.9 without Unicode support.  At the moment Unicode support is now planned for version 1.10 which I have already started work on and will be released soon.
