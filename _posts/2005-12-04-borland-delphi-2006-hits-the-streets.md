It's true.  <a href="http://www.borland.com/delphi">Borland Delphi 2006</a> is shipping.  Unfortunately I still do not have my copy which I pre-ordered back at the beginning of November.  So much for a first come, first serve approach.  According to my order status, my order has been back ordered!  <br /><br />I hope my copy comes soon.  I want to start up a new dev environment where I use the Borland Developers Studio 2006 for all my Delphi and .NET 1.1 programming.  I'll use Visual Studio 2005 for .NET 2.0 development since the Borland Developers Studio will not have support for .NET 2.0.  This is unfortunate but I understand it had something to do with Microsoft consistently changing the release schedule for .NET 2.0 and a license agreement between Microsoft and Borland regarding the distribution of pre-RTM releases of the .NET 2.0 Framework.  Unfortunately I can't find the link to the blog that explains why this latest release from Borland does not support .NET Framework 2.0.  I'll post the URL if I find the link.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I anxiously wait for my copy of Delphi 2006.
