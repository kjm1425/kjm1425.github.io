## 5 things I will NOT miss about life in New York (in no particular order):

1. The people - Sometimes there just too many people here.
2. The traffic - I'm sick and tired of traffic so bad that it takes an hour and half just to drive 10 miles.
3. The small apartments - I feel like I live in a shoebox at times.
4. The high cost living - Rent is the worst.  I'm tired of paying more per month for rent than what a typical American pays monthly for on a home mortgage.
5. Over priced beer - I have paid as much as $12 for a 12oz bottle of Bud Light.  And $5 to $7 is not uncommon.

## 5 things I WILL MISS about life in New York (in no particular order):

1. The people - New York City has some of the nicest people in the world.  And I have made some great friends here.
2. Bars and pubs - New York City has great places to hang out, meet people, and have a couple of cold brews.
3. The energy - I still remember the first time I walked out of Penn Station and onto a Manhattan street.  I immediately felt the energy from the city, and I love that feeling.
4. $2 beers - There's nothing like finding a real deal in New York City.  And there's a special feeling you get when you know where to find the $2 beers and can eat dinner for under $3.50.
5. Living in New York City - There is no greater city than New York City in my opinion.  I'm definitely going to miss living here.
