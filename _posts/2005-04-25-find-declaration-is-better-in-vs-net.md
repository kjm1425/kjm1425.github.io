title: 'Find Declaration is better in VS.NET'
category: uncategorized

While Delphi has the cool hotkeys for navigating source code - Alt+\[Up Arrow\] to find declaration and Alt+\[Left Arrow\] to return - it can only find the declaration within the current project.  On the other hand, VS.NET can find the declaration across all projects within the solution.  And since I partition my C# across multiple projects I have to say VS.NET's find declaration feature is better than Delphi's.
