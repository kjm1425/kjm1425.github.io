Tonight I run my first 5K run through Central Park.  I am running in the JPMorgan Chase Corporate Challenge <a href="http://www.jpmorganchasecc.com/races/ny3/ny3home02.htm">New York Race #3</a>.  I was really looking forward to tonight's run but after hurting my leg a week ago I don't know if I am as excited.  With my luck I will finish the run with a good time but end up in the doctor's office tomorrow morning for yet more X-rays.  It figures it is the same leg I hurt earlier in the year snowboarding.  Maybe I am getting too old for this sort of stuff.  Nah...
