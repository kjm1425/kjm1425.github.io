title: 'Xbox 360 Problem Could Be the Power Supply Connectors'
category: uncategorized

I just read from the Xbox forums that the problem I am experiencing might be caused by the power supply connectors.  Apparently some believe there is <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/536098/ShowPost.aspx">residue on the metal and pins</a> preventing the power supply from send full power to the console.  I wiped down all exposed metal pieces.  Hopefully this will fix the problem.
