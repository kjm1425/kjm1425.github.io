A new version of [Reflector](http://www.aisto.com/roeder/dotnet/) is out.  It is a class browser for .NET components and assemblies.  It has a very nice C#/VB decompiler, which seems to be better then Anakrino, imo.  Reflector is a must have for .NET devs.

**Update:** It seems that Reflector does not show private code in the decompiler window whereas Anakrino does.  Still, both are nice and both are a must have.

**Yet another update:** Steve pointed out to me that Reflector will show private code.  Go to View|Options to enable visibility on private and internal code.  And thanks for the pointer Steve.

Lesson learned: I need to play with all features before posting on my blog.  On the other hand, the fact that someone pointed out a feature I overlooked after reading my blog is pretty dang cool, and shows the power of weblogging.
