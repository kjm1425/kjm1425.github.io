Last night Melanie and I saw <a href="http://www.chicagothemusical.com/">Chicago</a>.  Entertaining but the crowd was not into it as much as the crowd at Hairspray.  My favorite part of Chicago?  The outfits.  Totally reminded me of the preferred style for many at Monday night <a href="http://members.aol.com/scenestl/bcpages.htm#Galaxy">Fetish night</a> in St. Louis.  I miss those Monday nights at time.
