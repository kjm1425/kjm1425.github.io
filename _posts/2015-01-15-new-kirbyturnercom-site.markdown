I have owned the vanity domain name [kirbyturner.com][1] for a long time, but I didn't anything with it after buying it. That changed back when I was writing [Learning iPad Programming][2]. My publisher asked that I setup a website that talks about me, so I finally put kirbyturner.com to use. Unfortunately I never liked the look of the site. I used a bland template to create the website quickly. The site was ugly, but it served its purpose. Then Justin Williams created a new "professional web site" for [himself][3].

My first thought after seeing Justin's new site was, "Wow! That looks really nice." My second thought was, "Man my site sucks donkey balls." So I spent the last couple of days working on a new look for [kirbyturner.com][1]. I just finished the site, and I can say with 100% certainty that the new site looks much, much better than my [old site][4]. Thanks for the inspiration, Justin.

Take a look at the new and improved [kirbyturner.com][1], and let me know what you think.
