I was heading up to Connecticut for an afternoon meeting so I scheduled a morning meeting at Grand Central Station.  As we drank our coffee and talked business, 18 year old "kids" (military of course) walked around carrying semi-automatic weapons.  Police were in full force at all the train stops from the West Village to Grand Central. Officers performed random sweeps on the trains including the one I took up to CT.  Definitely not a typical day in the office.<br /><br />On a related note, I had time to kill between my meeting at Grand Central and the train ride up to CT.  I decided to check my e-mail so I walked out of the station in search of a Starbucks.  To no surprise there was a large Starbucks just a block and a half away.  I have often joked about Starbucks being on every corner but today it paid off.  And it paid Starbucks as well as I order an ice coffee and signed up with T-Mobile for a day pass.  Gotta love the convenience provided by Starbucks.<br /><br /><br />
