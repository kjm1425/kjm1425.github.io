Believe it or not I finished the 5K run \[officially 3.5 miles\] through Central Park.  I am excited that I did it.  And I finished in 35 minutes!

There were tons of other participates in the run, which made it hard at times.  I had to zig-zag through crowds of people throughout the run.  My friend Dave and I ran together, which was nice.  And he helped motivate me in the last quarter mile when I would have preferred walking.

In the end, I am glad I did the run.  Of course my leg injury seems to have gotten worse as a result and I am having trouble walking today.  And walking is a very common practice for most New Yorkers so it totally sucks.  But I'm still glad I did it.
