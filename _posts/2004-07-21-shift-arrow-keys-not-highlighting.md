title: 'Shift + Arrow Keys Not Highlighting'
category: uncategorized
---

<p>I learned that some Dell Latitude D600 configurations will prevent Shift + Arrow key combination from highlighting text within a VMware guest OS.&nbsp; The problem also prevents selecting multiple list items too.&nbsp; I found that the problem is caused by the ATI tray icon application.&nbsp; Disable the ATI tray icon application to get Shift + Arrow key highlighting working again within Windows guest OS'es.</p>
