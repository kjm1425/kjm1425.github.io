title: 'Add-on Cube Speaker for Griffin Evolve'
category: uncategorized
---

Yesterday I mentioned (via <a href="http://www.twitter.com/kirbyt">Twitter</a>) that Melanie and I had purchased the Griffin Evolve wireless sound system.  I happy with the purchase but was made happier today when I found out that Griffin is now selling <a href="http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/reviews/entry/griffin-evolve-add-on-cube-speaker-speaker-charging-base/">add-on cube speakers</a>.  Maybe I'll throw a couple of speakers upstairs so Rowan can rock out from his room.
