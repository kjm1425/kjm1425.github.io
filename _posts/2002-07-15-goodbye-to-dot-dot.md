As some already know, my grandmother Dot passed away last week.  I left for Memphis as soon as I heard the news to be with the family.  Although it is sad that Dot is no longer with us, she is in a much better place now.
<br />
<br />Dot was an amazing woman and a wonderful grandmother.  I still have fond memories of summer times at her place with a frig packed with Jell-O, Easter Saturday dying eggs, and nights playing Aggravation and watching Carson.  I can't think of a better person to have as a grandmother.  I love you, Dot.
