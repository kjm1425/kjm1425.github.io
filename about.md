### Summary

I am currently a Product Manager at Code.org where I focus on the K-12 student experience serving 20M students annually. Before Code.org, I was a PM at Microsoft, working in both Windows and Bing. At Bing I worked on search experiences, including the results from queries about covid-19 and the 2020 election. Outside of work, I play the flute in a jazz ensemble, I like to paint, and always find myself looking for creative projects.
